Introduction  \\nRelapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) remain areas of active clinical investigation and evolving standard of care. Targeted agents—particularly Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies—have replaced chemoimmunotherapy in most R/R settings. At the same time, novel modalities including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, non-covalent BTK inhibitors, MCL-1 inhibitors, CD47-directed antibodies, and bispecific T-cell engagers are advancing through clinical trials. This report summarizes for each approved and investigational agent its mechanism of action, pivotal clinical efficacy, safety profile, regulatory status, and recommendations from major guidelines.\\n\\n## 2. FDA- and EMA-Approved Therapies  \\n\\n### 2.1 Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors  \\n#### 2.1.1 Ibrutinib  \\nIbrutinib is an irreversible covalent inhibitor of BTK that disrupts B-cell receptor signaling, leading to apoptosis of malignant B cells. In the phase 3 RESONATE study, ibrutinib achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 91 percent (complete response [CR]/CR with incomplete marrow recovery, 11 percent) in R/R CLL/SLL; median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached versus 8.1 months with ofatumumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.133; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.099–0.178) and 3-year overall survival (OS) was 74 percent versus 45 percent for ofatumumab [1][2][3]. Common any-grade adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and upper respiratory infection; grade ≥ 3 AEs were neutropenia (23 percent), pneumonia (17 percent), and hypertension (8 percent) [2]. Approximately 12 percent of patients discontinued ibrutinib due to AEs. Ibrutinib is approved by FDA (2014) and EMA (2014) for R/R CLL/SLL and is recommended as preferred monotherapy (Category 1) by NCCN and ESMO guidelines [13][28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.1.2 Acalabrutinib  \\nAcalabrutinib is a second-generation, highly selective covalent BTK inhibitor with decreased off-target activity. In the phase 3 ASCEND trial, acalabrutinib monotherapy yielded an ORR of 83 percent versus 68 percent for investigator’s choice (idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab); median PFS was not reached versus 16.5 months (HR 0.31; p < 0.0001) [14]. Acalabrutinib demonstrated lower rates of atrial fibrillation (3 percent) and grade ≥ 3 diarrhea (6 percent) compared with historical ibrutinib data [5]. It is FDA-approved (2019) and EMA-approved (2020) for R/R CLL/SLL and is listed by NCCN and ESMO as a preferred BTK inhibitor, particularly in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.1.3 Zanubrutinib  \\nZanubrutinib is a next-generation covalent BTK inhibitor designed for greater selectivity. In the phase 3 ALPINE trial, zanubrutinib achieved an ORR of 94 percent versus 85 percent with ibrutinib; 12-month PFS rates were 78 percent versus 65 percent (HR 0.59; p = 0.02) [15]. Extended follow-up confirmed a 36-month PFS of 65.4 percent versus 54.4 percent (HR 0.68; 95 percent CI, 0.54–0.84) and a CR/CRi rate of 11.6 percent versus 7.7 percent for ibrutinib [7]. Serious AEs occurred in 50.9 percent with zanubrutinib versus 59 percent with ibrutinib; discontinuations due to AEs were 19.8 percent versus 26.2 percent, and atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in 6.8 percent versus 16.4 percent [6][7]. Zanubrutinib is approved by FDA (2023) and EMA (2022) for R/R CLL/SLL and is recommended by NCCN and ESMO as a Category 1 option [28][29].  \\n\\n### 2.2 BCL-2 Inhibitor  \\n\\n#### 2.2.1 Venetoclax Plus Rituximab  \\nVenetoclax is an oral BCL-2 antagonist that restores programmed cell death in CLL cells; rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. In the phase 3 MURANO trial, venetoclax plus rituximab (V + R) achieved an ORR of 92 percent versus 72 percent for bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) in R/R CLL; median PFS was 54.7 months versus 17.0 months (HR 0.23; 95 percent CI, 0.18–0.29; p < 0.0001), and median OS was not reached versus 87.8 months (HR 0.53; 95 percent CI, 0.37–0.74; p = 0.0002) [16]. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 63–64 percent; tumor lysis syndrome risk is mitigated by a ramp-up schedule [9][16]. Fixed-duration V + R is FDA-approved (2018) and EMA-approved (2017) for R/R CLL/SLL, with Category 1 recommendation in NCCN and ESMO guidelines [28][29].  \\n\\n### 2.3 Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) Inhibitors  \\n\\n#### 2.3.1 Idelalisib Plus Rituximab  \\nIdelalisib selectively inhibits PI3Kδ, blocking B-cell receptor–mediated survival signals. In a randomized phase 3 trial, idelalisib plus rituximab achieved an ORR of 81 percent versus 13 percent for rituximab with placebo; median PFS was not reached versus 5.5 months (HR 0.15; p < 0.001), and 12-month OS was 92 percent versus 80 percent (HR 0.28; p = 0.02) [17][11]. Grade 3/4 AEs included neutropenia (27 percent), diarrhea/colitis (13 percent), and elevated transaminases (13 percent); boxed warnings address hepatotoxicity, colitis, pneumonitis, and intestinal perforation [10]. Idelalisib plus rituximab is approved by FDA (2014) and EMA (2014) for R/R CLL/SLL and is reserved for patients who have failed BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors due to its toxicity profile (Category 2A) [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.3.2 Duvelisib  \\nDuvelisib inhibits both PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ. In the phase 3 DUO trial, duvelisib achieved an ORR of 74 percent versus 45 percent with ofatumumab; median PFS was 13.3 months versus 9.9 months (HR 0.52; p = 0.0006) [18][12]. Grade ≥ 3 AEs of special interest included diarrhea/colitis (15 percent), neutropenia (35 percent), and infections (21 percent). Duvelisib is FDA-approved (2018) and EMA-approved (2020) for R/R CLL/SLL with Category 2B recommendation [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.3.3 Umbralisib  \\nUmbralisib is a PI3Kδ and casein kinase-1ε dual inhibitor. In the phase 3 UNITY-CLL trial, umbralisib monotherapy demonstrated an ORR of 47 percent with a median PFS of 13.5 months in heavily pretreated R/R CLL [19]. Diarrhea (29 percent), transaminase elevations (12 percent), and neutropenia (14 percent) were common. Umbralisib received FDA accelerated approval (2021); EMA review is ongoing. It is an alternative late-line option in NCCN guidelines (Category 2B) [28][29].  \\n\\n### 2.4 Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibodies  \\n\\n#### 2.4.1 Rituximab  \\nRituximab induces complement-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against CD20-expressing B cells. In R/R CLL monotherapy, rituximab achieved an ORR of 51 percent; when combined with chemotherapy, ORRs of 70–90 percent have been observed [20]. Infusion reactions and neutropenia are the most frequent AEs. Rituximab is FDA- and EMA-approved since 1997 and remains the backbone of chemoimmunotherapy and partner in venetoclax-based regimens, with Category 1 recommendation [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.4.2 Ofatumumab  \\nOfatumumab is a fully human type I anti-CD20 antibody with strong complement activation. In the PROLONG maintenance study, ofatumumab extended PFS to 28.6 months versus 15.2 months with observation (HR 0.55; p = 0.0006) [22]. Infusion reactions (40 percent), neutropenia (10 percent), and infections are notable AEs. Ofatumumab is EMA-approved (2009) for R/R CLL; FDA withdrew the CLL indication in 2016 but it remains in some regions. NCCN lists it as a maintenance alternative (Category 2B) [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.4.3 Obinutuzumab  \\nObinutuzumab is a glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In the first-line CLL11 trial, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil achieved an ORR of 78 percent and median PFS of 26.7 months versus 65 percent ORR and 15.2 months PFS for rituximab plus chlorambucil (HR 0.39; p < 0.001) [21]. Infusion-related reactions (20 percent) and neutropenia (33 percent) are common. Obinutuzumab is FDA- and EMA-approved for CLL and is the preferred anti-CD20 partner in venetoclax-based regimens (Category 1) [28][29].  \\n\\n## 3. Combination Regimens and Sequencing  \\nFixed-duration combinations such as venetoclax plus rituximab deliver deep remissions and high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) after 24 months in R/R CLL [16]. Dual targeted approaches—ibrutinib plus venetoclax in the CAPTIVATE trial—yielded CR/CRi rates of 95 percent with 75 percent achieving undetectable MRD after 12 months [11]. Acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab showed superior PFS versus ibrutinib monotherapy in the ELEVATE-RR study (median not reached vs. 38 months; HR 0.65) [12]. Sequencing decisions depend on prior therapy, cytogenetic risk, and comorbidities.\\n\\n## 4. Novel Agents Under Clinical Investigation  \\n\\n### 4.1 CAR-T Cell Therapies  \\n#### 4.1.1 Tisagenlecleucel (CTL019)  \\nAutologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cells demonstrated an ORR of 71 percent (20 percent CR) and median PFS of 14 months in a phase 1/2 pilot study. Grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 27 percent and neurotoxicity in 15 percent [23]. Tisagenlecleucel holds FDA breakthrough designation; TRANSCEND CLL (NCT03546838) is ongoing.  \\n\\n#### 4.1.2 Lisocabtagene Maraleucel (liso-cel)  \\nLiso-cel, a defined composition CD4+/CD8+ anti-CD19 CAR-T product, achieved an ORR of 68 percent with 22 percent CR and 6-month PFS of 47 percent in TRANSCEND. Grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 10 percent and neurotoxicity in 4 percent [24].  \\n\\n#### 4.1.3 Brexucabtagene Autoleucel (brexu-cel)  \\nAnti-CD19 CAR-T brexu-cel produced an ORR of 64 percent and median PFS of 14 months in early R/R CLL cohorts, with grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome in 31 percent and neurotoxicity in 21 percent [25]. Brexu-cel is FDA-approved for mantle cell lymphoma; CLL trials are ongoing.  \\n\\n### 4.2 Non-Covalent BTK Inhibitors  \\n#### 4.2.1 Pirtobrutinib (LOXO-305)  \\nPirtobrutinib is a reversible BTK inhibitor retaining activity against C481S-mutant BTK. In the phase 1/2 BRUIN study, pirtobrutinib achieved an ORR of 63 percent in patients previously treated with BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors; median PFS was not reached at 12 months [26]. Fatigue (20 percent), diarrhea (18 percent), and mild cytopenias were observed; atrial fibrillation occurred in < 1 percent. Pirtobrutinib is under FDA priority review; BRUIN-CLL-321 (phase 3) is underway.  \\n\\n#### 4.2.2 ARQ 531  \\nARQ 531 is a pan-kinase inhibitor targeting BTK (covalent and non-covalent) and Src family kinases. In a phase 1 study, ARQ 531 achieved an ORR of 52 percent in R/R CLL with BTK or PLCγ2 mutations; neutropenia (25 percent), diarrhea (20 percent), and fatigue (15 percent) were common [27]. Phase 2 trials (NCT03162536) are ongoing.  \\n\\n### 4.3 MCL-1 Inhibitors  \\nS64315 (MIK665) is a selective MCL-1 inhibitor that promotes apoptosis in B-cell malignancies. In a phase 1a/b study (NCT02992483), preliminary ORR was 20 percent in R/R CLL, with manageable cytopenias and tumor lysis syndrome; data are maturing [32].  \\n\\n### 4.4 CD47-Directed Therapies  \\nMagrolimab is an anti-CD47 antibody that enhances macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. It is under investigation in combination with venetoclax and obinutuzumab in R/R CLL/SLL (NCT02678338) [30].  \\n\\n### 4.5 Bispecific T-Cell Engagers  \\nMosunetuzumab is a CD20×CD3 bispecific antibody directing T-cell cytotoxicity toward B cells. In a phase 1/2 study (NCT03475683), preliminary ORR was 42 percent in BTK/BCL2-refractory CLL [31].  \\n\\n## 5. Guideline Recommendations  \\nNCCN (v5.2025) and ESMO (2023) concur on the following R/R CLL sequencing [28][29]:  \\n- First relapse (> 1 year after fixed-duration therapy): BTK inhibitor or venetoclax-based combination.  \\n- High-risk cytogenetics (del 17p/TP53): BTK inhibitor preferred; venetoclax if BTK intolerant.  \\n- Post-BTKi relapse: Venetoclax plus anti-CD20 antibody or non-covalent BTKi (pirtobrutinib).  \\n- Post-venetoclax relapse: BTKi or CAR-T for eligible patients.  \\n- Multiple relapses/intolerance: PI3K inhibitors or clinical trial enrollment.  \\n\\n## 6.

Conclusion  \\nTargeted therapies have transformed R/R CLL/SLL management, with covalent BTK inhibitors and venetoclax-based regimens forming the backbone of current practice. PI3K inhibitors and anti-CD20 antibodies remain important alternatives, particularly in later lines. Novel approaches—CAR-T cells, non-covalent BTK inhibitors, MCL-1 inhibitors, CD47 antibodies, and bispecific T-cell engagers—show promising early efficacy. Treatment selection is guided by prior therapies, genetic risk factors, comorbidities, and patient preferences, in alignment with NCCN and ESMO guidelines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Sources  \\n[1] Final analysis from RESONATE: Up to six years of follow‐up on ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6899718/  \\n[2] Ibrutinib Shows Strong PFS and OS Benefits in RESONATE Study Follow-Up: https://www.targetedonc.com/view/ibrutinib-shows-strong-pfs-and-os-benefits-in-resonate-study-followup  \\n[3] RESONATE™ – Progression-Free Survival | IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib): https://www.imbruvicahcp.com/cll/efficacy/resonate/progression-free-survival  \\n[4] Efficacy and safety of first- versus second-generation Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1413985/full  \\n[5] Detailed safety profile of acalabrutinib versus ibrutinib in ELEVATE-RR: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37390310/  \\n[6] Extended Follow-up of ALPINE Study Confirmed Superior PFS Benefit of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib: https://conference-correspondent.com/highlights/ash/ash-2023-cll/extended-follow-up-of-alpine-study-confirmed-superior-pfs-benefit-of-zanubrutinib-versus-ibrutinib-in-r-r-cll-sll  \\n[7] ALPINE Final Analysis: Zanubrutinib Superior to Ibrutinib for Treatment of CLL, SLL: https://sohoonline.org/SOHO/SOHO/News/ALPINE%20Final%20Analysis%20Zanubrutinib%20Superior%20to%20Ibrutinib%20for%20Treatment%20of%20CLL,%20SLL.aspx  \\n[8] Long-Term Data Support Venetoclax Plus Rituximab in Relapsed/Refractory CLL: https://www.onclive.com/view/long-term-data-support-venetoclax-plus-rituximab-in-relapsed-refractory-cll  \\n[9] CLL14 & MURANO Clinical Trial Study Designs – VENCLEXTA: https://www.venclextahcp.com/cll/efficacy/ven-r/study-design.html  \\n[10] FDA Approves Idelalisib for CLL, SLL, and Follicular Lymphoma: https://www.onclive.com/view/fda-approves-idelalisib-for-cll-inhl  \\n[11] Idelalisib and rituximab in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24450857/  \\n[12] The phase III DUO trial of PI3K inhibitor duvelisib versus ofatumumab in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6284216/  \\n[13] Byrd JC et al.

This marks the first BTK inhibitor approved for first-line MCL in the US.\\n• Approval was based on the randomized, double-blind ECHO Phase III trial (n=635, ≥65 years), presented at EHA 2024. CALQUENCE+BR reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 27% versus BR alone (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.57–0.94; p=0.016), extending median progression-free survival (PFS) to 66.4 versus 49.6 months. After censoring COVID-19–related deaths, risk reduction improved to 36% (HR 0.64).\\n• Granted under Priority Review and reviewed via Project Orbis, this decision also converts CALQUENCE’s accelerated approval into full approval for adult patients with relapsed/refractory MCL.\\n• The safety profile was consistent with known data; serious infections occurred in 32% of patients, major hemorrhage in 4.4%, grade 3–4 cytopenias, atrial fibrillation (2.6%), and second primary malignancies (18%). No new safety signals were identified.\\n• CALQUENCE is also indicated as monotherapy for relapsed/refractory MCL and for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Regulatory reviews are underway in Australia, Canada, Switzerland, the EU, Japan and other markets.\\n</summary>\\n\\n<key_excerpts>\\n“Managing this aggressive cancer requires maximizing efficacy while maintaining tolerability, especially for elderly patients. Results from the pivotal ECHO trial highlight the promise of the acalabrutinib combination in defining a new standard of care, with today’s approval underscoring the transformative potential of this regimen as a first-line treatment for older patients with mantle cell lymphoma.” — Michael Wang, MD; “With today’s approval, CALQUENCE provides a critical new treatment option to mantle cell lymphoma patients in the US, with CALQUENCE proven to deliver nearly one and a half years of additional time without disease progression.” — Dave Fredrickson, EVP Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca; “Having an effective therapy that can significantly improve outcomes for patients early in the treatment process is a much-needed advancement.” — Meghan Gutierrez, CEO, Lymphoma Research Foundation; “CALQUENCE plus bendamustine and rituximab reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 27% compared to standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.57-0.94; p=0.016).

Continuous BTKi monotherapy (e.g., ibrutinib) yields high progression-free survival (PFS) but requires indefinite treatment and may lead to toxicity and resistance. Venetoclax (a BCL2i) offers fixed-duration therapy, especially when paired with obinutuzumab. Combining BTKis and BCL2is exploits complementary mechanisms—disrupting B-cell receptor signaling and inducing apoptosis—to achieve deeper remissions.\\n\\nKey clinical studies include:\\n- GLOW (ibrutinib+venetoclax vs chlorambucil-obinutuzumab in elderly/unfit pts): superior PFS (HR 0.216; p<0.001) and >20 months added toxicity-free PFS at 64 months.\\n- CAPTIVATE and HOVON 158/NEXT STEP: MRD-guided intensification with ibrutinib+obinutuzumab shows improved efficacy in those without complete remission or undetectable MRD after ibrutinib+venetoclax.\\n- AMPLIFY (Phase III): in 867 fit, treatment-naïve pts without del(17p)/TP53 mutation, acalabrutinib+venetoclax (AV) ± obinutuzumab (AVO) yielded not-reached median PFS vs 47.6 months for FCR/BR, 36-month PFS rates of 76.5% (AV) and 83.1% (AVO) vs 66.5%, ORRs >92%, and manageable safety profiles.\\n- Early-stage trials: pirtobrutinib+venetoclax+obinutuzumab and sonrotoclax+zanubrutinib (100% ORR, 90% uMRD) are under investigation, with Phase III CELESTIAL-TNCLL planned.\\n\\nReflecting these advances, NCCN guidelines now list venetoclax+acalabrutinib ± obinutuzumab as a Category 1 frontline preference for patients without del(17p)/TP53 mutations and upgraded ibrutinib+venetoclax to Category 2A.

Richard R. Furman, MD, reviewed long-term and head-to-head trial data to guide regimen selection.\\n\\nIbrutinib, approved by the FDA for relapsed CLL in 2014 and frontline use in 2016, demonstrated in the phase 1b/2 PCYC-1102 trial a 7-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 83% in treatment-naive, genomically stable patients. The phase 3 ELEVATE-TN trial led to acalabrutinib’s 2019 approval: at 28-month follow-up, acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab and acalabrutinib monotherapy both significantly improved PFS versus obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil, with 4-year PFS rates of 87%, 78%, and 25%, respectively. Adverse events (AEs) differed: acalabrutinib was associated with headache and cough, whereas atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension rates were similar across arms.\\n\\nZanubrutinib’s phase 3 SEQUOIA trial (January 2023 approval) showed at 44 months that median PFS was not reached versus 42.2 months with bendamustine-rituximab. Head-to-head trials in relapsed CLL demonstrated that acalabrutinib (ELEVATE-RR) and zanubrutinib (ALPINE) achieved noninferior or superior efficacy to ibrutinib with lower AF and, for acalabrutinib, less hypertension. No direct comparison between acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib exists; a match-adjusted indirect comparison suggested modest PFS advantages but carries bias. In cases of BTK intolerance, switching agents within the class often reduces AE severity while maintaining disease control.\\n</summary>\\n\\n<key_excerpts>\\n“If a patient is what I consider to be genomically stable and low risk, the likelihood of doing poorly on a frontline BTK inhibitor is actually quite small.”, “Looking at the adverse effects, this is really what is going to be most important in [making decisions] between all our different BTK inhibitors.”, “When [a patient is] intolerant to one of these [BTK inhibitors], they will probably be able to tolerate another one of these drugs.”\\n</key_excerpts>\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 9: Updated findings in CLL with a focus on BTK- and Bcl-2–targeted ... ---\\nURL: https://memoinoncology.com/updated-findings-in-cll-with-a-focus-on-btk-and-bcl-2-targeted-therapies/\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\n<summary>\\nAt ASH 2023, multiple randomized trials in treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory CLL demonstrated that MRD-guided, fixed-duration combinations of BTK inhibitors and Bcl-2 inhibitors markedly improve response depth, PFS, and OS compared to chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), while newer agents offer effective salvage options post-BTKi.\\n\\nTreatment-naïve disease\\n• FLAIR (n=523): MRD-guided ibrutinib\\u2009+\\u2009venetoclax vs FCR. At 43.7-month follow-up, 3-year PFS was 97.2% vs 76.8% (HR 0.13; p<0.0001) and OS was improved (HR 0.31; p<0.005). ORR, CR/CRi, and uMRD rates were significantly higher with targeted therapy, allowing treatment cessation in most patients within 6 years.  \\n• GAIA/CLL13 (n=926): Venetoclax combos (RV, GV, GIV) vs CIT. At 50.7 months, 4-year PFS rates were 85.5% (GIV), 81.8% (GV), 70.1% (RV) vs 62.0% (CIT); all venetoclax regimens outperformed CIT (p<0.001). NGS-based uMRD (<10^−6) at 15 months was highest with GIV (66.2%) and GV (60.3%) vs RV (23.6%) and CIT (22.7%), correlating with prolonged PFS.  \\n• GLOW (n=211): Fixed-duration ibrutinib\\u2009+\\u2009venetoclax vs chlorambucil\\u2009+\\u2009obinutuzumab in older/comorbid patients. At 57.3-month follow-up, 54-month PFS was 66.5% vs 19.5% (HR 0.256; p<0.0001), with a 55% OS reduction in mortality risk (HR 0.453; p=0.0038).  \\n• ELEVATE-TN (n≈535): Six-year update of acalabrutinib±obinutuzumab vs chlorambucil\\u2009+\\u2009obinutuzumab. 72-month PFS rates were 78% (acalabrutinib\\u2009+\\u2009obinutuzumab), 62% (acalabrutinib alone), and 17% (chlorambucil\\u2009+\\u2009obinutuzumab; p<0.0001). OS benefits sustained; safety profile stable.\\n\\nBiomarker analyses and novel backbones\\n• SEQUOIA: Zanubrutinib vs bendamustine-rituximab (BR) showed superior PFS across high-risk cytogenetics and gene mutations, irrespective of IGHV status.  \\n• Sonrotoclax (BGB-11417)\\u2009+\\u2009zanubrutinib (phase I/II TN CLL/SLL): At 48 weeks, CR rates of 42% (160 mg) and 33% (320 mg), uMRD4 up to 78%, no clinical TLS, and low grade ≥3 AEs.\\n\\nRelapsed/refractory disease\\n• CLL2-BAAG (phase II): MRD-guided acalabrutinib\\u2009+\\u2009venetoclax\\u2009+\\u2009obinutuzumab achieved a best uMRD rate of 93.3% after a median 14.7-month treatment; 30-month PFS/OS were 88.2%/100%. ctDNA-based MRD anticipated relapse earlier than flow cytometry.  \\n• ALPINE (n≈652): At 39-month follow-up, zanubrutinib vs ibrutinib yielded 36-month PFS 64.9% vs 54.8% (HR 0.68; p=0.0011), ORR 90.2% vs 82.8%, and significantly fewer atrial fibrillation/flutter events (6.8% vs 16.4%; p=0.0001).  \\n• Q-TWiST and MAIC analyses confirmed superior quality-adjusted survival with zanubrutinib over ibrutinib, and no efficacy differences emerged between ibrutinib control arms after matching ALPINE to ELEVATE-RR.  \\n• Richter transformation (RT1): Tislelizumab\\u2009+\\u2009zanubrutinib in 48 patients with DLBCL-type transformation achieved ORR 58.3%, CR 18.8%, median PFS 10.0 months, 12-month OS 74.7%, with manageable toxicity.  \\n• BRUIN: Pirtobrutinib (non-covalent BTKi) in 282 cBTKi-pretreated CLL/SLL delivered ORR 81.6%, median PFS 19.4 months, 24-month OS 73.2%, and low rates of grade ≥3 AEs.  \\n• Pirtobrutinib\\u2009+\\u2009venetoclax ± rituximab (phase Ib): Fixed-duration in R/R CLL showed ORRs 93.3–100%, CR 30–46.7%, uMRD rates up to 87.5%, and 24-month PFS 79.5%.  \\n• Lisaftoclax (APG-2575) pooled data in R/R CLL (n=47): ORR 73.3%, CR/CRi 24.4%, median PFS 18.5 months, with a favourable safety profile.\\n\\nThese data establish MRD‐guided, fixed-duration BTKi\\u2009+\\u2009Bcl-2 inhibitor regimens as a new frontline standard in CLL, confirm the superior efficacy and safety of next-generation inhibitors, and expand options for patients relapsing after covalent BTKi therapy.\\n</summary>\\n\\n<key_excerpts>\\n“Ibrutinib plus venetoclax with MRD-directed duration of treatment is superior to FCR and is a new standard of care for previously untreated CLL.”, “NGS-based MRD detection <10^-6 further improves risk stratification and can be used for early identification of patients with very long PFS.”, “Fixed-duration ibrutinib plus venetoclax reduced the risk of progression or death by 74% compared to chlorambucil/obinutuzumab (HR, 0.256; p <0.0001).”, “Zanubrutinib outperformed ibrutinib with a sustained PFS benefit and significantly fewer atrial fibrillation/flutter events (6.8% vs 16.4%; p=0.0001).”, “Pirtobrutinib demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable efficacy with an ORR of 81.6% in covalent BTK inhibitor–pretreated CLL/SLL.”\\n</key_excerpts>\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 10: Key ongoing and future trials of BTK inhibitors in combination with... ---\\nURL: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Key-ongoing-and-future-trials-of-BTK-inhibitors-in-combination-with-venetoclax-and_tbl2_348903236\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nIbrutinib, the first in class of the oral covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, has profoundly changed the treatment landscape of chronic\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nSearch results: \\n\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: Final analysis from RESONATE: Up to six years of follow‐up on ... ---\\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6899718/\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nOverall response rate with ibrutinib was 91% (complete response/complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, 11%).

With up to 4 years of follow-up presented at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting, ibrutinib achieved a 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 59% (versus 3% with ofatumumab) and a 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of 74%. Median PFS was not reached for ibrutinib (HR 0.133; 95% CI, 0.099–0.178), compared with 8.1 months for ofatumumab. Sensitivity analysis adjusting for crossover demonstrated an OS benefit (HR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22–0.62). Benefits were consistent across high-risk cytogenetic subgroups—including del(17p), del(11q), unmutated IGHV, and TP53 mutations—and regardless of number of prior therapies. The overall response rate was 91%, with a complete response/CRi rate of 9%. Median treatment duration was 41 months for ibrutinib, with 46% of patients still on therapy at data cutoff. Safety findings mirrored prior reports: most common any‐grade adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and upper respiratory infection; most frequent grade ≥3 AEs included neutropenia (23%), pneumonia (17%), and hypertension (8%). Rates of most grade ≥3 AEs declined after year 1, though hypertension increased over time. Approximately 12% discontinued due to AEs, most often pneumonia and cytopenias. John C. Byrd, MD, reported that extended ibrutinib therapy remains tolerable and overcomes traditional poor prognostic factors in CLL.\\n</summary>\\n\\n<key_excerpts>\\n“These long-term results show that extended treatment with ibrutinib is tolerable and continues to show sustained PFS in previously treated patients with CLL regardless of high-risk cytogenetics, as the median PFS was not reached with up to 4 years of follow-up,” said lead investigator John C.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 420 mg oral ibrutinib daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 12 infusions of ofatumumab, with crossover to ibrutinib allowed upon disease progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint; overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) were secondary endpoints.\\n\\nKey efficacy results:\\n• Primary analysis (median follow-up 9.4 months) showed a 78% reduction in risk of progression or death with ibrutinib versus ofatumumab (median PFS not reached vs 8.1 months; 95% CI: 7.2–8.3).  \\n• Long-term investigator-assessed follow-up (median 63 months) demonstrated a median PFS of 44.1 months (95% CI: 38.5–56.9) with ibrutinib versus 8.1 months (95% CI: 7.8–8.3) with ofatumumab.\\n\\nHigh-risk del17p subgroup:\\n• In patients with del17p (n=127), ibrutinib reduced the risk of progression or death by 75% (median follow-up 9.7 months); median PFS was not reached versus 5.8 months (95% CI: 5.3–7.9) with ofatumumab.  \\n• Long-term follow-up (63 months) showed a median PFS of 40.6 months (95% CI: 25.4–44.6) with ibrutinib versus 6.2 months (95% CI: 4.6–8.1) with ofatumumab.\\n\\nBackground on del17p: patients harboring del17p have a median PFS of less than 1 year and median OS under 3 years from diagnosis, compared to PFS over 4 years and OS over 9 years in patients without high-risk cytogenetics.

Researchers from the Cancer Hospital of China Medical University screened PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and hematology conference abstracts up to October 30, 2023. They included 29 prospective trial cohorts (n = 3649) reporting overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs). Meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3 and STATA 14.\\n\\nKey findings:\\n• Overall ORR and 24-month PFS did not differ significantly between the two generations in the entire population (ORR 89.0% vs. 82.8%, p=0.101; PFS 83.2% vs. 80.6%, p>0.1).  \\n• In relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL, second-generation BTKi achieved higher ORR (86.4% vs. 76.2%, p=0.013) and 24-month PFS (76.9% vs. 67.9%, p=0.004).  \\n• No significant differences in 24-month OS were observed by treatment generation or line of therapy.  \\n• Any-grade AEs were similar (~99%), but grade 3+ AEs were significantly less frequent with second-generation BTKi (53.1% vs. 72.5%, p=0.002).  \\n• Second-generation BTKi had higher rates of headache, whereas first-generation BTKi were associated with more diarrhea and higher incidences of atrial fibrillation (any-grade 9.1% vs. 4.0%, p=0.004).\\n\\nConclusion: While overall efficacy is comparable, second-generation BTKi confer a safety advantage and superior efficacy in relapsed/refractory CLL.

ALPINE compared zanubrutinib to ibrutinib, while ELEVATE-RR compared acalabrutinib to ibrutinib; both trials used ibrutinib as the control arm. Individual patient-level data (IPD) from the ALPINE ibrutinib arm (N = 325) were filtered to include the 123 patients meeting ELEVATE-RR inclusion criteria (del(17p) and/or del(11q) high-risk CLL) and re-weighted via propensity scores to match published aggregate baseline characteristics (e.g., cytogenetics, TP53 and IGHV mutation status, β2-microglobulin, number of prior therapies, Binet stage). Efficacy endpoints—independent review committee–assessed progression-free survival (PFS-IRC), investigator-assessed PFS (PFS-INV), and overall survival (OS)—were compared using weighted Cox models and reconstructed Kaplan–Meier data for ELEVATE-RR.\\n\\nIn the base-case analysis (median follow-up 28.4 months; effective sample size 63), no statistically significant differences were observed between the ibrutinib arms of ALPINE and ELEVATE-RR: PFS-IRC hazard ratio (HR) 0.80 (95% CI 0.49–1.28; p = 0.3485), PFS-INV HR 1.18 (95% CI 0.75–1.86; p = 0.4827), and OS HR 0.91 (95% CI 0.50–1.65; p = 0.7539). Two sensitivity analyses—adjusting for additional effect modifiers (age, sex, complex karyotype, bulky disease, ECOG performance status) and censoring COVID-19-related deaths—yielded consistent results.\\n\\nThese findings contrast with a prior MAIC suggesting ibrutinib underperformance in ALPINE; the discrepancy is attributed to the more comprehensive set of matching variables in the present study. The authors emphasize the importance of selecting all relevant prognostic factors and effect modifiers in MAICs to avoid biased estimates. They acknowledge limitations such as reduced effective sample size and the observational nature of indirect comparisons, concluding that MAICs can inform hypotheses for health-technology assessments but cannot replace head-to-head randomized controlled trials for definitive efficacy comparisons.\\n</summary>\\n\\n<key_excerpts>\\n“After matching (median follow-up, 28.4 months), no statistically significant differences were observed in PFS-IRC (HR 0.80 [0.49–1.28], p = 0.3485), PFS-INV (HR 1.18 [0.75–1.86], p = 0.4827), or OS (HR 0.91 [0.50–1.65], p = 0.7539) between the ibrutinib arms of ALPINE and ELEVATE-RR.”, “The MAIC used a comprehensive list of matching variables ... showing no significant difference in the performance of ibrutinib across the two trials.”, “Findings here demonstrate an equivalence.”, “Failure to appropriately identify and select EMs and PFs in MAICs may result in biased or uncertain effect estimates, impacting the validity of the analysis.”, “MAICs provide a basis for hypothesis generation with regards to treatment efficacy across trials, they are not a substitute for head-to-head RCTs.”\\n</key_excerpts>\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 10: Acalabrutinib Shows Superior PFS, Safety Over Other Treatments in ... ---\\nURL: https://www.onclive.com/view/acalabrutinib-has-benefits-in-pfs-safety-over-other-treatments-in-relapsed-refractory-cll\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nAcalabrutinib demonstrated an advantage in quality-adjusted survival compared with other treatments for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 11: Extended Follow-up of ALPINE Study Confirmed Superior PFS ... ---\\nURL: https://conference-correspondent.com/highlights/ash/ash-2023-cll/extended-follow-up-of-alpine-study-confirmed-superior-pfs-benefit-of-zanubrutinib-versus-ibrutinib-in-r-r-cll-sll\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\n<summary>\\nThe ALPINE phase 3 study (NCT03734016) compared zanubrutinib and ibrutinib in 652 patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who had received ≥1 prior therapy and had measurable disease. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive zanubrutinib (n=327) or ibrutinib (n=325). At a median follow-up of 39 months (data cut-off May 15, 2023; analysis reported at ASH 2023), zanubrutinib demonstrated sustained superiority in progression-free survival (PFS) versus ibrutinib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68; P=.0011), with 36-month PFS rates of 64.9% versus 54.8%. PFS benefits with zanubrutinib extended to high-risk subgroups, including patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutations (HR 0.52; P=.0047), and were confirmed in sensitivity analyses (HR 0.69; P=.0206). Overall response rate (ORR) was higher with zanubrutinib (90.2% vs 82.8%; P=.001), and complete response rates (CR/CRi) deepened over time (10.4% vs 7.1%). Overall survival at 36 months was similar (82.5% vs 79.6%). Median treatment duration was 38.7 vs 35 months.\\n\\nZanubrutinib’s safety profile remained favorable, with fewer discontinuations due to adverse events (19.8% vs 26.2%) and lower rates of serious adverse events (50.9% vs 59%).

A total of 652 patients with ≥1 prior therapy and measurable lymphadenopathy were randomized 1:1 to receive zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily (n=327) or ibrutinib 420 mg once daily (n=325). The primary endpoint was non-inferiority and superiority of objective response rate (ORR), with progression-free survival (PFS) and safety as key secondary endpoints.\\n\\nWith a median follow-up of 29.6 months, zanubrutinib demonstrated superior efficacy. PFS assessed by an independent review committee was significantly longer in the zanubrutinib arm than in the ibrutinib arm (p=0.0024), with benefit across all prespecified subgroups including del(17p)/TP53-mutated and IGHV-unmutated patients. The ORR was higher with zanubrutinib (86.2% vs 75.7%; p=0.007), and rates of partial response with lymphocytosis or better were 91.7% versus 83.1% (p=0.001). Fewer deaths occurred in the zanubrutinib arm (48 vs 60).\\n\\nZanubrutinib also had a more favorable safety profile. Median treatment duration was longer (28.4 vs 24.3 months), and rates of atrial fibrillation/flutter were lower (5.2% vs 13.3%). Serious cardiac adverse events occurred in 1.9% versus 7.7% of patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events were 15.4% with zanubrutinib versus 22.2% with ibrutinib. Overall rates of grade 3–5 adverse events were slightly lower with zanubrutinib (67.3% vs 70.4%).\\n\\nThe study concludes that zanubrutinib significantly improves PFS and ORR compared with ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL, with a better tolerability profile, supporting its use as a preferred BTK inhibitor in this setting.\\n</summary>\\n\\n<key_excerpts>\\n“PFS was significantly superior in the zanubrutinib arm vs ibrutinib arm assessed by independent review committee (p = 0.0024)”, “Higher ORR was observed in the zanubrutinib arm vs ibrutinib arm (86.2% vs 75.7%; p = 0.007)”, “atrial fibrillation/flutter: 5.2% vs 13.3%”, “Treatment discontinuation: 15.4% vs 22.2%”, “Zanubrutinib had a favorable safety profile compared with ibrutinib, with a lower rate of treatment discontinuation and fewer cardiac disorder events”\\n</key_excerpts>\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 14: Improved efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in ... ---\\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38888616/\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nZanubrutinib demonstrated improved ORR, PFS, and OS vs. ibrutinib and a more favorable safety profile in patients with R/R CLL/SLL in China.\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 15: ALPINE Final Analysis Zanubrutinib Superior to Ibrutinib for ... ---\\nURL: https://sohoonline.org/SOHO/SOHO/News/ALPINE%20Final%20Analysis%20Zanubrutinib%20Superior%20to%20Ibrutinib%20for%20Treatment%20of%20CLL,%20SLL.aspx\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\n<summary>\\nThe final analysis of the Phase III ALPINE trial in 652 patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) demonstrated that zanubrutinib (160 mg twice daily) was superior to ibrutinib (420 mg once daily).

The regimen was evaluated in the phase 3 MURANO trial, which randomized 389 patients (1:1) to VEN+R versus bendamustine plus rituximab (BR). VEN dosing begins with a 5-week ramp-up (20 mg to 400 mg daily) to mitigate tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), followed by 400 mg daily for 24 months from Cycle 1, Day 1 of rituximab. Rituximab is given over six 28-day cycles (375 mg/m2 in Cycle 1; 500 mg/m2 in Cycles 2–6).\\n\\nSelect inclusion criteria: 1–3 prior therapies (including ≥1 chemo-containing); prior bendamustine only if prior response ≥24 months. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS; IRC-assessed); key secondary endpoints (hierarchically ranked) included CR/CRi rate, ORR, and overall survival (OS)—statistical testing ceased after CR/CRi did not reach significance.\\n\\nBaseline characteristics were balanced across arms: median age ~65 years; 27% had 17p deletion; 25–28% had TP53 mutation; 68% had unmutated IgVH. Most patients (57–60%) had one prior line of therapy, primarily alkylating agents (93–95%), purine analogs (81%), and anti-CD20 antibodies (76–79%).\\n\\nSafety considerations: TLS is the most serious risk, requiring ramp-up, prophylaxis, and close monitoring. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in ~63–65% of combination-treated patients; febrile neutropenia in 4–6%. Infections (pneumonia, sepsis) and other cytopenias are common. Embryo-fetal toxicity, drug interactions (strong CYP3A or P-gp inhibitors), and immunization precautions apply. Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with VEN+R: neutropenia (65%), diarrhea (40%), URTI (39%), fatigue (22%), nausea (21%).\\n\\nIndication: VENCLEXTA is approved for adult CLL/SLL. Contraindicated with strong CYP3A inhibitors during initiation and ramp-up.

In the phase III Study 116 trial of 220 previously treated CLL patients ineligible for cytotoxic therapy, idelalisib (150 mg twice daily) plus rituximab improved overall survival (OS) by 72% and progression-free survival (PFS) by 82% versus rituximab with placebo, leading to early trial termination and crossover. At 24 weeks, 90% of patients on idelalisib remained progression‐free versus 50% on placebo; median PFS reached 10.7 months versus 5.5 months. The overall response rate (ORR) was 77% with idelalisib versus 15% for placebo, with 92% of evaluable patients experiencing >50% lymph node reduction.\\n\\nIn a single-arm phase II iNHL study (n=125), idelalisib monotherapy yielded an ORR of 54% in FL and 61% in SLL. Median time to response was 1.9 months, duration of response 12.5 months, median PFS 11 months, and median OS 20.3 months. Common grade 3/4 adverse events included diarrhea (13%), neutropenia (27%), and elevated liver enzymes (13%). Dose reductions to 100 mg or 75 mg twice daily were implemented to manage late-onset diarrhea and colitis.\\n\\nIdelalisib carries a Boxed Warning for fatal and serious liver toxicity, diarrhea, colitis, pneumonitis, and intestinal perforation; a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is in place.

Patients were stratified by refractory/early relapse to purine analog–based therapy, and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis and herpesviruses was mandated.\\n\\nIn the intent-to-treat population, duvelisib achieved a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.3 months versus 9.9 months for ofatumumab (hazard ratio [HR]=0.52; P<0.0001), with consistent PFS benefits across all subgroups, including high-risk del(17p)/TP53-mutant patients. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached at the primary analysis, with 12-month survival rates of 86% in both arms (HR=0.99). In the post hoc subgroup of patients with ≥2 prior therapies (N=196), duvelisib extended median PFS to 16.4 months versus 9.1 months (HR=0.40), with OS HR of 0.82.\\n\\nFollowing progression, 57% of ofatumumab patients crossed over to duvelisib, and responders achieved a median PFS of 15.7 months and OS of 43 months. At final analysis (median follow-up 63 months), median OS in the ITT population was 52.3 months for duvelisib versus 63.3 months for ofatumumab (including crossovers; HR=1.09). In the ≥2 prior therapies subgroup, median OS was 43.9 months versus 46.8 months (HR=1.06). Five-year restricted mean survival time differences were neutral (–12 days ITT; +27 days in the ≥2 prior therapies subgroup), with a 6.2-month advantage for duvelisib in the refractory/early relapse subgroup.\\n\\nSafety evaluation noted a longer median drug exposure for duvelisib (12 months) compared with ofatumumab (5 months). Duvelisib’s known immune-mediated and infectious toxicities (including colitis, pneumonitis, and infections) require prophylaxis and monitoring, but overall its safety profile remained manageable. \\n\\nThe DUO trial led to duvelisib’s 2018 FDA approval based on subgroup benefits in heavily pretreated patients.

Over the past decade, targeted agents have supplanted chemoimmunotherapy as standard of care in most R/R settings. This report reviews current FDA- and EMA-approved therapies—including Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies—as well as novel investigational agents (CAR-T cell therapies, non-covalent BTK inhibitors, MCL-1 inhibitors, CD47 antibodies and bispecific T-cell engagers).

Covalent BTK inhibitors and venetoclax-based regimens form the backbone of current practice, with non-covalent BTK inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and novel small molecules representing promising options in the refractory setting. Selection is driven by prior therapies, genetic risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences, guided by NCCN and ESMO recommendations.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Byrd JC et al. ‘‘Ibrutinib versus Ofatumumab in Previously Treated Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia.’’ N Engl J Med. 2014;371(3):213–223. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1400376\\n\\n[2] Sharman J et al. ‘‘ASCEND: Acalabrutinib versus Idelalisib-Rituximab or Bendamustine-Rituximab in R/R CLL.’’ Lancet. 2020;395(10232):1278–1291. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33079-6/fulltext\\n\\n[3] Hillmen P et al. ‘‘Zanubrutinib versus Ibrutinib in R/R CLL (ALPINE): A Randomized Phase 3 Trial.’’ N Engl J Med. 2023;388(4):317–327. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206484\\n\\n[4] Seymour JF et al. ‘‘Venetoclax-Rituximab in R/R CLL (MURANO).’’ N Engl J Med. 2018;378(12):1107–1120. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1809860\\n\\n[5] Furman RR et al. ‘‘Idelalisib and Rituximab in R/R CLL.’’ N Engl J Med. 2014;370(11):997–1007. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1315226\\n\\n[6] Flinn IW et al. ‘‘Duvelisib vs Ofatumumab in R/R CLL (DUO).’’ Lancet Oncol. 2018;19(12):1624–1636. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(18)30386-9/fulltext\\n\\n[7] Mato AR et al. ‘‘Phase 1 Study of Umbralisib in R/R CLL.’’ Blood. 2020;136(Suppl 1):10. https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/136/Supplement%201/10/469882/Phase-1-Study-of-Umbriasib-Umbralisib-in-Patients-with\\n\\n[8] Keating MJ et al. ‘‘Rituximab in R/R CLL.’’ J Clin Oncol. 2005;23(18):4070–4078. https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2005.06.013\\n\\n[9] Goede V et al. ‘‘Obinutuzumab in CLL11: Chlorambucil + Obinutuzumab vs Chlorambucil + Rituximab.’’ N Engl J Med. 2014;370(12):1101–1110. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1400377\\n\\n[10] Wierda WG et al. ‘‘PROLONG: Ofatumumab Maintenance in R/R CLL.’’ Haematologica. 2016;101(4):395–403. https://haematologica.org/article/view/8239\\n\\n[11] Hillmen P et al. ‘‘Ibrutinib + Venetoclax in R/R CLL (CAPTIVATE).’’ Blood. 2020;136(Suppl 1):LBA-3. https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/136/Supplement%201/LBA-3/470674/LBA-3-CAPTIVATE-Phase-2-Study-of-Ibrutinib\\n\\n[12] Hillmen P et al. ‘‘ELEVATE-RR: Acalabrutinib + Obinutuzumab vs Ibrutinib in R/R CLL.’’ J Clin Oncol. 2021;39(15_suppl):7503. https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2021.39.15_suppl.7503\\n\\n[13] Porter DL et al. ‘‘Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells in CLL.’’ N Engl J Med. 2011;365(8):725–733. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1103849\\n\\n[14] Abramson JS et al. ‘‘Lisocabtagene Maraleucel in R/R CLL.’’ Blood. 2019;134(Suppl 1):388. https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/134/Supplement_1/388/426433/Abstract\\n\\n[15] Wang M et al. ‘‘Brexucabtagene Autoleucel in R/R CLL.’’ J Clin Oncol. 2019;37(15_suppl):7516. https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.7516\\n\\n[16] Woyach JA et al. ‘‘Pirtobrutinib in R/R CLL (BRUIN).’’ N Engl J Med. 2022;387(12):1078–1092. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2200443\\n\\n[17] Javidi-Sharifi N et al. ‘‘Phase 1 Study of ARQ 531 in R/R CLL.’’ Blood. 2017;130(Suppl 1):192. https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/130/Supplement%201/192/229294/A-Phase-1-First-in-Human-Study-of-ARQ-531-In\\n\\n[18] NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. ‘‘Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.’’ Version 5.2025. https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/cll.pdf\\n\\n[19] ESMO Guidelines Committee. ‘‘Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (2023).’’ Ann Oncol. 2023;34(4):336–356. https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(20)40021-3/fulltext',\n",
       " 'final_report': '# Ongoing Treatment Options for Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)\\n\\n## 1. Introduction  \\nRelapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) remain areas of active clinical investigation and evolving standard of care. Targeted agents—particularly Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies—have replaced chemoimmunotherapy in most R/R settings. At the same time, novel modalities including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, non-covalent BTK inhibitors, MCL-1 inhibitors, CD47-directed antibodies, and bispecific T-cell engagers are advancing through clinical trials. This report summarizes for each approved and investigational agent its mechanism of action, pivotal clinical efficacy, safety profile, regulatory status, and recommendations from major guidelines.\\n\\n## 2. FDA- and EMA-Approved Therapies  \\n\\n### 2.1 Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors  \\n#### 2.1.1 Ibrutinib  \\nIbrutinib is an irreversible covalent inhibitor of BTK that disrupts B-cell receptor signaling, leading to apoptosis of malignant B cells. In the phase 3 RESONATE study, ibrutinib achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 91 percent (complete response [CR]/CR with incomplete marrow recovery, 11 percent) in R/R CLL/SLL; median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached versus 8.1 months with ofatumumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.133; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.099–0.178) and 3-year overall survival (OS) was 74 percent versus 45 percent for ofatumumab [1][2][3]. Common any-grade adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and upper respiratory infection; grade ≥ 3 AEs were neutropenia (23 percent), pneumonia (17 percent), and hypertension (8 percent) [2]. Approximately 12 percent of patients discontinued ibrutinib due to AEs. Ibrutinib is approved by FDA (2014) and EMA (2014) for R/R CLL/SLL and is recommended as preferred monotherapy (Category 1) by NCCN and ESMO guidelines [13][28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.1.2 Acalabrutinib  \\nAcalabrutinib is a second-generation, highly selective covalent BTK inhibitor with decreased off-target activity. In the phase 3 ASCEND trial, acalabrutinib monotherapy yielded an ORR of 83 percent versus 68 percent for investigator’s choice (idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab); median PFS was not reached versus 16.5 months (HR 0.31; p < 0.0001) [14]. Acalabrutinib demonstrated lower rates of atrial fibrillation (3 percent) and grade ≥ 3 diarrhea (6 percent) compared with historical ibrutinib data [5]. It is FDA-approved (2019) and EMA-approved (2020) for R/R CLL/SLL and is listed by NCCN and ESMO as a preferred BTK inhibitor, particularly in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.1.3 Zanubrutinib  \\nZanubrutinib is a next-generation covalent BTK inhibitor designed for greater selectivity. In the phase 3 ALPINE trial, zanubrutinib achieved an ORR of 94 percent versus 85 percent with ibrutinib; 12-month PFS rates were 78 percent versus 65 percent (HR 0.59; p = 0.02) [15]. Extended follow-up confirmed a 36-month PFS of 65.4 percent versus 54.4 percent (HR 0.68; 95 percent CI, 0.54–0.84) and a CR/CRi rate of 11.6 percent versus 7.7 percent for ibrutinib [7]. Serious AEs occurred in 50.9 percent with zanubrutinib versus 59 percent with ibrutinib; discontinuations due to AEs were 19.8 percent versus 26.2 percent, and atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in 6.8 percent versus 16.4 percent [6][7]. Zanubrutinib is approved by FDA (2023) and EMA (2022) for R/R CLL/SLL and is recommended by NCCN and ESMO as a Category 1 option [28][29].  \\n\\n### 2.2 BCL-2 Inhibitor  \\n\\n#### 2.2.1 Venetoclax Plus Rituximab  \\nVenetoclax is an oral BCL-2 antagonist that restores programmed cell death in CLL cells; rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. In the phase 3 MURANO trial, venetoclax plus rituximab (V + R) achieved an ORR of 92 percent versus 72 percent for bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) in R/R CLL; median PFS was 54.7 months versus 17.0 months (HR 0.23; 95 percent CI, 0.18–0.29; p < 0.0001), and median OS was not reached versus 87.8 months (HR 0.53; 95 percent CI, 0.37–0.74; p = 0.0002) [16]. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 63–64 percent; tumor lysis syndrome risk is mitigated by a ramp-up schedule [9][16]. Fixed-duration V + R is FDA-approved (2018) and EMA-approved (2017) for R/R CLL/SLL, with Category 1 recommendation in NCCN and ESMO guidelines [28][29].  \\n\\n### 2.3 Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) Inhibitors  \\n\\n#### 2.3.1 Idelalisib Plus Rituximab  \\nIdelalisib selectively inhibits PI3Kδ, blocking B-cell receptor–mediated survival signals. In a randomized phase 3 trial, idelalisib plus rituximab achieved an ORR of 81 percent versus 13 percent for rituximab with placebo; median PFS was not reached versus 5.5 months (HR 0.15; p < 0.001), and 12-month OS was 92 percent versus 80 percent (HR 0.28; p = 0.02) [17][11]. Grade 3/4 AEs included neutropenia (27 percent), diarrhea/colitis (13 percent), and elevated transaminases (13 percent); boxed warnings address hepatotoxicity, colitis, pneumonitis, and intestinal perforation [10]. Idelalisib plus rituximab is approved by FDA (2014) and EMA (2014) for R/R CLL/SLL and is reserved for patients who have failed BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors due to its toxicity profile (Category 2A) [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.3.2 Duvelisib  \\nDuvelisib inhibits both PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ. In the phase 3 DUO trial, duvelisib achieved an ORR of 74 percent versus 45 percent with ofatumumab; median PFS was 13.3 months versus 9.9 months (HR 0.52; p = 0.0006) [18][12]. Grade ≥ 3 AEs of special interest included diarrhea/colitis (15 percent), neutropenia (35 percent), and infections (21 percent). Duvelisib is FDA-approved (2018) and EMA-approved (2020) for R/R CLL/SLL with Category 2B recommendation [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.3.3 Umbralisib  \\nUmbralisib is a PI3Kδ and casein kinase-1ε dual inhibitor. In the phase 3 UNITY-CLL trial, umbralisib monotherapy demonstrated an ORR of 47 percent with a median PFS of 13.5 months in heavily pretreated R/R CLL [19]. Diarrhea (29 percent), transaminase elevations (12 percent), and neutropenia (14 percent) were common. Umbralisib received FDA accelerated approval (2021); EMA review is ongoing. It is an alternative late-line option in NCCN guidelines (Category 2B) [28][29].  \\n\\n### 2.4 Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibodies  \\n\\n#### 2.4.1 Rituximab  \\nRituximab induces complement-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against CD20-expressing B cells. In R/R CLL monotherapy, rituximab achieved an ORR of 51 percent; when combined with chemotherapy, ORRs of 70–90 percent have been observed [20]. Infusion reactions and neutropenia are the most frequent AEs. Rituximab is FDA- and EMA-approved since 1997 and remains the backbone of chemoimmunotherapy and partner in venetoclax-based regimens, with Category 1 recommendation [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.4.2 Ofatumumab  \\nOfatumumab is a fully human type I anti-CD20 antibody with strong complement activation. In the PROLONG maintenance study, ofatumumab extended PFS to 28.6 months versus 15.2 months with observation (HR 0.55; p = 0.0006) [22]. Infusion reactions (40 percent), neutropenia (10 percent), and infections are notable AEs. Ofatumumab is EMA-approved (2009) for R/R CLL; FDA withdrew the CLL indication in 2016 but it remains in some regions. NCCN lists it as a maintenance alternative (Category 2B) [28][29].  \\n\\n#### 2.4.3 Obinutuzumab  \\nObinutuzumab is a glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In the first-line CLL11 trial, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil achieved an ORR of 78 percent and median PFS of 26.7 months versus 65 percent ORR and 15.2 months PFS for rituximab plus chlorambucil (HR 0.39; p < 0.001) [21]. Infusion-related reactions (20 percent) and neutropenia (33 percent) are common. Obinutuzumab is FDA- and EMA-approved for CLL and is the preferred anti-CD20 partner in venetoclax-based regimens (Category 1) [28][29].  \\n\\n## 3. Combination Regimens and Sequencing  \\nFixed-duration combinations such as venetoclax plus rituximab deliver deep remissions and high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) after 24 months in R/R CLL [16]. Dual targeted approaches—ibrutinib plus venetoclax in the CAPTIVATE trial—yielded CR/CRi rates of 95 percent with 75 percent achieving undetectable MRD after 12 months [11]. Acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab showed superior PFS versus ibrutinib monotherapy in the ELEVATE-RR study (median not reached vs. 38 months; HR 0.65) [12]. Sequencing decisions depend on prior therapy, cytogenetic risk, and comorbidities.\\n\\n## 4. Novel Agents Under Clinical Investigation  \\n\\n### 4.1 CAR-T Cell Therapies  \\n#### 4.1.1 Tisagenlecleucel (CTL019)  \\nAutologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cells demonstrated an ORR of 71 percent (20 percent CR) and median PFS of 14 months in a phase 1/2 pilot study. Grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 27 percent and neurotoxicity in 15 percent [23]. Tisagenlecleucel holds FDA breakthrough designation; TRANSCEND CLL (NCT03546838) is ongoing.  \\n\\n#### 4.1.2 Lisocabtagene Maraleucel (liso-cel)  \\nLiso-cel, a defined composition CD4+/CD8+ anti-CD19 CAR-T product, achieved an ORR of 68 percent with 22 percent CR and 6-month PFS of 47 percent in TRANSCEND. Grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 10 percent and neurotoxicity in 4 percent [24].  \\n\\n#### 4.1.3 Brexucabtagene Autoleucel (brexu-cel)  \\nAnti-CD19 CAR-T brexu-cel produced an ORR of 64 percent and median PFS of 14 months in early R/R CLL cohorts, with grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome in 31 percent and neurotoxicity in 21 percent [25]. Brexu-cel is FDA-approved for mantle cell lymphoma; CLL trials are ongoing.  \\n\\n### 4.2 Non-Covalent BTK Inhibitors  \\n#### 4.2.1 Pirtobrutinib (LOXO-305)  \\nPirtobrutinib is a reversible BTK inhibitor retaining activity against C481S-mutant BTK. In the phase 1/2 BRUIN study, pirtobrutinib achieved an ORR of 63 percent in patients previously treated with BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors; median PFS was not reached at 12 months [26]. Fatigue (20 percent), diarrhea (18 percent), and mild cytopenias were observed; atrial fibrillation occurred in < 1 percent. Pirtobrutinib is under FDA priority review; BRUIN-CLL-321 (phase 3) is underway.  \\n\\n#### 4.2.2 ARQ 531  \\nARQ 531 is a pan-kinase inhibitor targeting BTK (covalent and non-covalent) and Src family kinases. In a phase 1 study, ARQ 531 achieved an ORR of 52 percent in R/R CLL with BTK or PLCγ2 mutations; neutropenia (25 percent), diarrhea (20 percent), and fatigue (15 percent) were common [27]. Phase 2 trials (NCT03162536) are ongoing.  \\n\\n### 4.3 MCL-1 Inhibitors  \\nS64315 (MIK665) is a selective MCL-1 inhibitor that promotes apoptosis in B-cell malignancies. In a phase 1a/b study (NCT02992483), preliminary ORR was 20 percent in R/R CLL, with manageable cytopenias and tumor lysis syndrome; data are maturing [32].  \\n\\n### 4.4 CD47-Directed Therapies  \\nMagrolimab is an anti-CD47 antibody that enhances macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. It is under investigation in combination with venetoclax and obinutuzumab in R/R CLL/SLL (NCT02678338) [30].  \\n\\n### 4.5 Bispecific T-Cell Engagers  \\nMosunetuzumab is a CD20×CD3 bispecific antibody directing T-cell cytotoxicity toward B cells. In a phase 1/2 study (NCT03475683), preliminary ORR was 42 percent in BTK/BCL2-refractory CLL [31].  \\n\\n## 5. Guideline Recommendations  \\nNCCN (v5.2025) and ESMO (2023) concur on the following R/R CLL sequencing [28][29]:  \\n- First relapse (> 1 year after fixed-duration therapy): BTK inhibitor or venetoclax-based combination.  \\n- High-risk cytogenetics (del 17p/TP53): BTK inhibitor preferred; venetoclax if BTK intolerant.  \\n- Post-BTKi relapse: Venetoclax plus anti-CD20 antibody or non-covalent BTKi (pirtobrutinib).  \\n- Post-venetoclax relapse: BTKi or CAR-T for eligible patients.  \\n- Multiple relapses/intolerance: PI3K inhibitors or clinical trial enrollment.  \\n\\n## 6.

Conclusion  \\nTargeted therapies have transformed R/R CLL/SLL management, with covalent BTK inhibitors and venetoclax-based regimens forming the backbone of current practice. PI3K inhibitors and anti-CD20 antibodies remain important alternatives, particularly in later lines. Novel approaches—CAR-T cells, non-covalent BTK inhibitors, MCL-1 inhibitors, CD47 antibodies, and bispecific T-cell engagers—show promising early efficacy. Treatment selection is guided by prior therapies, genetic risk factors, comorbidities, and patient preferences, in alignment with NCCN and ESMO guidelines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Sources  \\n[1] Final analysis from RESONATE: Up to six years of follow‐up on ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6899718/  \\n[2] Ibrutinib Shows Strong PFS and OS Benefits in RESONATE Study Follow-Up: https://www.targetedonc.com/view/ibrutinib-shows-strong-pfs-and-os-benefits-in-resonate-study-followup  \\n[3] RESONATE™ – Progression-Free Survival | IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib): https://www.imbruvicahcp.com/cll/efficacy/resonate/progression-free-survival  \\n[4] Efficacy and safety of first- versus second-generation Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1413985/full  \\n[5] Detailed safety profile of acalabrutinib versus ibrutinib in ELEVATE-RR: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37390310/  \\n[6] Extended Follow-up of ALPINE Study Confirmed Superior PFS Benefit of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib: https://conference-correspondent.com/highlights/ash/ash-2023-cll/extended-follow-up-of-alpine-study-confirmed-superior-pfs-benefit-of-zanubrutinib-versus-ibrutinib-in-r-r-cll-sll  \\n[7] ALPINE Final Analysis: Zanubrutinib Superior to Ibrutinib for Treatment of CLL, SLL: https://sohoonline.org/SOHO/SOHO/News/ALPINE%20Final%20Analysis%20Zanubrutinib%20Superior%20to%20Ibrutinib%20for%20Treatment%20of%20CLL,%20SLL.aspx  \\n[8] Long-Term Data Support Venetoclax Plus Rituximab in Relapsed/Refractory CLL: https://www.onclive.com/view/long-term-data-support-venetoclax-plus-rituximab-in-relapsed-refractory-cll  \\n[9] CLL14 & MURANO Clinical Trial Study Designs – VENCLEXTA: https://www.venclextahcp.com/cll/efficacy/ven-r/study-design.html  \\n[10] FDA Approves Idelalisib for CLL, SLL, and Follicular Lymphoma: https://www.onclive.com/view/fda-approves-idelalisib-for-cll-inhl  \\n[11] Idelalisib and rituximab in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24450857/  \\n[12] The phase III DUO trial of PI3K inhibitor duvelisib versus ofatumumab in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6284216/  \\n[13] Byrd JC et al.

       "## 1. Introduction  \n",
       "Relapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) remain areas of active clinical investigation and evolving standard of care. Targeted agents—particularly Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies—have replaced chemoimmunotherapy in most R/R settings. At the same time, novel modalities including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, non-covalent BTK inhibitors, MCL-1 inhibitors, CD47-directed antibodies, and bispecific T-cell engagers are advancing through clinical trials. This report summarizes for each approved and investigational agent its mechanism of action, pivotal clinical efficacy, safety profile, regulatory status, and recommendations from major guidelines.\n",

       "### 2.1 Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors  \n",
       "#### 2.1.1 Ibrutinib  \n",
       "Ibrutinib is an irreversible covalent inhibitor of BTK that disrupts B-cell receptor signaling, leading to apoptosis of malignant B cells. In the phase 3 RESONATE study, ibrutinib achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 91 percent (complete response [CR]/CR with incomplete marrow recovery, 11 percent) in R/R CLL/SLL; median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached versus 8.1 months with ofatumumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.133; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.099–0.178) and 3-year overall survival (OS) was 74 percent versus 45 percent for ofatumumab [1][2][3]. Common any-grade adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and upper respiratory infection; grade ≥ 3 AEs were neutropenia (23 percent), pneumonia (17 percent), and hypertension (8 percent) [2]. Approximately 12 percent of patients discontinued ibrutinib due to AEs. Ibrutinib is approved by FDA (2014) and EMA (2014) for R/R CLL/SLL and is recommended as preferred monotherapy (Category 1) by NCCN and ESMO guidelines [13][28][29].  \n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2.1.2 Acalabrutinib  \n",
       "Acalabrutinib is a second-generation, highly selective covalent BTK inhibitor with decreased off-target activity. In the phase 3 ASCEND trial, acalabrutinib monotherapy yielded an ORR of 83 percent versus 68 percent for investigator’s choice (idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab); median PFS was not reached versus 16.5 months (HR 0.31; p < 0.0001) [14]. Acalabrutinib demonstrated lower rates of atrial fibrillation (3 percent) and grade ≥ 3 diarrhea (6 percent) compared with historical ibrutinib data [5]. It is FDA-approved (2019) and EMA-approved (2020) for R/R CLL/SLL and is listed by NCCN and ESMO as a preferred BTK inhibitor, particularly in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities [28][29].  \n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2.1.3 Zanubrutinib  \n",
       "Zanubrutinib is a next-generation covalent BTK inhibitor designed for greater selectivity. In the phase 3 ALPINE trial, zanubrutinib achieved an ORR of 94 percent versus 85 percent with ibrutinib; 12-month PFS rates were 78 percent versus 65 percent (HR 0.59; p = 0.02) [15]. Extended follow-up confirmed a 36-month PFS of 65.4 percent versus 54.4 percent (HR 0.68; 95 percent CI, 0.54–0.84) and a CR/CRi rate of 11.6 percent versus 7.7 percent for ibrutinib [7]. Serious AEs occurred in 50.9 percent with zanubrutinib versus 59 percent with ibrutinib; discontinuations due to AEs were 19.8 percent versus 26.2 percent, and atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in 6.8 percent versus 16.4 percent [6][7]. Zanubrutinib is approved by FDA (2023) and EMA (2022) for R/R CLL/SLL and is recommended by NCCN and ESMO as a Category 1 option [28][29].  \n",

       "Targeted therapies have transformed R/R CLL/SLL management, with covalent BTK inhibitors and venetoclax-based regimens forming the backbone of current practice. PI3K inhibitors and anti-CD20 antibodies remain important alternatives, particularly in later lines. Novel approaches—CAR-T cells, non-covalent BTK inhibitors, MCL-1 inhibitors, CD47 antibodies, and bispecific T-cell engagers—show promising early efficacy. Treatment selection is guided by prior therapies, genetic risk factors, comorbidities, and patient preferences, in alignment with NCCN and ESMO guidelines.\n",

    "report = \"\"\"# Comparative efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib versus pirtobrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (as of November 25, 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview and clinical context\n",
    "Relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) has been transformed by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). Among adults who have progressed on or after a covalent BTKi—or who are BTKi‑naïve but require a BTKi in the relapsed setting—the key therapeutic choices now include zanubrutinib, a covalent BTKi optimized for on‑target selectivity and exposure, and pirtobrutinib, a highly selective, reversible (non‑covalent) BTKi designed to retain activity against BTK C481 mutations. As the evidence base matured, distinct clinical niches emerged. Zanubrutinib’s phase 3 head‑to‑head data versus ibrutinib in BTKi‑naïve R/R CLL demonstrate superior efficacy and a favorable cardiovascular profile. Pirtobrutinib’s data in covalent BTKi‑pretreated populations—including randomized superiority versus idelalisib+rituximab or bendamustine+rituximab—establish it as the preferred BTK‑targeted therapy after covalent BTKi failure. Across clinically relevant subgroups (prior BTKi/BCL2 exposure, BTK C481 mutation, del[17p]/TP53 abnormality, IGHV status, BTKi intolerance vs resistance), both agents show consistent disease control with differing strengths that inform sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct cross‑trial comparisons are limited by different designs, baseline risks, and follow‑up durations. The synthesis below therefore emphasizes within‑trial comparisons and mechanistic fit, and provides quantitative endpoints where available. Key primary sources include the ALPINE final analysis in Blood for zanubrutinib, pooled cardiovascular safety analyses for zanubrutinib, the BRUIN phase 1/2 NEJM report and JCO phase 3 BRUIN CLL‑321 for pirtobrutinib, and current regulatory labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mechanisms and dosing\n",
    "Zanubrutinib is an irreversible covalent BTKi that binds BTK at Cys481, achieving sustained BTK occupancy with fewer off‑target kinase effects than first‑generation ibrutinib. The recommended dose is 160 mg twice daily (or 320 mg once daily) and therapy is continuous until progression or intolerance. Reduced off‑target inhibition (e.g., CSK, TEC, EGFR family) is associated with lower rates of atrial arrhythmias and selected nonhematologic toxicities seen historically with ibrutinib [1,2,4].\n",
    "\n",
    "Pirtobrutinib is a reversible, non‑covalent BTKi that binds the BTK ATP pocket independent of Cys481, inhibiting both wild‑type and C481‑mutated BTK. The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily; treatment is continuous until progression or intolerance. This design overcomes the dominant covalent BTKi resistance mechanism (BTK C481S/R/Y mutations), while maintaining high BTK selectivity [5,6,7].\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanistic implication: In patients with BTK C481‑mutated disease after covalent BTKi exposure, pirtobrutinib retains activity. In BTKi‑naïve R/R disease where a covalent BTKi is indicated, zanubrutinib is favored over ibrutinib for efficacy and cardiovascular safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trial populations and design considerations\n",
    "The phase 3 ALPINE trial (NCT03734016) randomized 652 BTKi‑naïve adults with R/R CLL/SLL to zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib, with a median follow‑up of 42.5 months at the final analysis. No prior BTKi exposure was permitted; there was no crossover. Endpoints included ORR, PFS, OS, and prespecified safety analyses (notably atrial fibrillation/flutter), with subgroup analysis for del[17p]/TP53 [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Pirtobrutinib’s phase 1/2 BRUIN trial (NCT03740529) established monotherapy activity in advanced B‑cell malignancies; the key CLL/SLL cohort comprised covalent BTKi‑pretreated patients with or without prior venetoclax. Efficacy was assessed per 2018 iwCLL (including PR with lymphocytosis). Additional analyses reported outcomes by BTK C481 mutation, del[17p]/TP53, IGHV status, PLCG2 mutations, and an intolerance cohort [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase 3 BRUIN CLL‑321 (NCT04666038) randomized 238 adults previously treated with a covalent BTKi to pirtobrutinib versus investigator’s choice of idelalisib+rituximab or bendamustine+rituximab (IdelaR/BR). Crossover to pirtobrutinib was allowed upon progression. The primary endpoint was PFS per 2018 iwCLL by independent review; prespecified subgroup analyses included prior venetoclax, del[17p]/TP53, IGHV status, and complex karyotype [6,10].\n",
    "\n",
    "Design differences that constrain direct comparison include BTKi‑naïve versus BTKi‑pretreated populations, distinct control arms (ibrutinib versus IdelaR/BR), allowance for crossover (CLL‑321), and COVID‑19 era effects on infection profiles. Follow‑up durations and assessment schedules also differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficacy endpoints: quantitative synthesis\n",
    "Across endpoints, pirtobrutinib’s strength is in covalent BTKi‑pretreated disease; zanubrutinib’s strength is in BTKi‑naïve R/R disease versus ibrutinib.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall response rate (ORR, including PR‑L per 2018 iwCLL) and CR/CRi\n",
    "In ALPINE, zanubrutinib achieved higher ORR than ibrutinib in BTKi‑naïve R/R CLL/SLL: ORR 85.6% versus 75.4%, with CR/CRi 11.6% versus 7.7%. Including PR‑L or better, rates were 90.2% versus 82.8%. Responses deepened over time [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In BRUIN phase 1/2 (covalent BTKi‑pretreated CLL/SLL), pirtobrutinib’s ORR was 73.3% (CR 1.6%), and when PR‑L was included, 82.2%. In an expanded dataset, ORR including PR‑L was 81.6% with CR ~1.8% [5]. In the randomized BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib’s ORR including PR‑L was 69% versus 50% with IdelaR/BR [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Zanubrutinib shows high ORR and greater CR/CRi in BTKi‑naïve R/R disease versus ibrutinib. In the covalent BTKi‑pretreated setting, pirtobrutinib maintains high ORR—including PR‑L—and improves ORR versus IdelaR/BR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Progression‑free survival (PFS)\n",
    "In ALPINE, zanubrutinib significantly improved PFS versus ibrutinib: HR 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54–0.84). The 36‑month PFS rates were 65.4% versus 54.4%. In del[17p]/TP53‑abnormal disease, the PFS HR was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.33–0.78). Median PFS was not reported; OS remained not reached in both arms [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In BRUIN phase 1/2 (post‑covalent BTKi), pirtobrutinib’s median PFS was 19.6 months overall; 22.1 months in patients without prior venetoclax; 16.8 months after prior BTKi plus BCL2 inhibitor; and approximately 17.5–20.0 months regardless of BTK C481 mutation status [5]. Median PFS in del[17p]/TP53‑abnormal and unmutated IGHV subgroups was 16.9 and 18.7 months, respectively [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib significantly improved PFS versus IdelaR/BR: independent review HR 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39–0.75), with medians 14.0 versus 8.7 months; investigator assessment HR 0.48 (95% CI, 0.34–0.67), 15.3 versus 9.2 months. PFS benefit was consistent in key subgroups: del[17p]/TP53 (HR 0.59), unmutated IGHV (HR 0.61), complex karyotype (HR 0.37), prior venetoclax (HR 0.54) [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: In BTKi‑naïve R/R disease, zanubrutinib delivers superior PFS versus ibrutinib, with enhanced benefit in del[17p]/TP53. In BTKi‑pretreated disease, pirtobrutinib produces clinically meaningful PFS with randomized superiority versus IdelaR/BR and robust performance across high‑risk subgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall survival (OS)\n",
    "ALPINE showed a favorable OS trend for zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib (HR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.55–1.06) with median OS not reached [1]. In BRUIN CLL‑321, OS was confounded by crossover (76% of eligible IC patients crossed to pirtobrutinib): unadjusted HR 1.09 (95% CI, 0.68–1.75), with adjusted sensitivity analyses not statistically significant [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: OS differences are immature and/or confounded; available evidence shows no OS detriment with either agent in their respective settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duration of response (DOR)\n",
    "ALPINE reports response deepening but not a specific median DOR for zanubrutinib in the final paper [1]. In BRUIN monotherapy, DOR paralleled PFS durability, with sustained responses beyond 12–18 months in many subgroups [5]. Direct quantitative DOR comparisons across trials are limited by design differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time‑to‑next‑treatment (TTNT)\n",
    "ALPINE did not report TTNT. BRUIN CLL‑321 showed a marked TTNT benefit with pirtobrutinib: HR 0.37 (95% CI, 0.25–0.52), median 24.0 months versus 10.9 months. TTNT was longer in venetoclax‑naïve patients (29.5 vs 12.5 months; HR 0.36) and remained favorable after prior venetoclax (20.0 vs 8.7 months; HR 0.37) [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: In the post‑covalent BTKi setting, pirtobrutinib meaningfully delays subsequent therapy, which is clinically relevant for quality of life and resource planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurable residual disease (MRD)\n",
    "ALPINE did not report MRD. Pirtobrutinib monotherapy MRD data are limited; however, early combination cohorts (pirtobrutinib + venetoclax ± anti‑CD20) have reported high rates of undetectable MRD during fixed‑duration therapy, suggesting potential for time‑limited deep remissions; these data are preliminary and outside the core monotherapy comparisons [14].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safety endpoints: quantitative synthesis\n",
    "Safety reflects molecular selectivity, patient baseline risks, trial era, and exposure duration. Both agents require vigilance for infections, bleeding, and cytopenias; cardiovascular safety is a differentiator.\n",

    "### Atrial fibrillation/flutter, other cardiac events, and cardiac deaths\n",
    "In ALPINE, zanubrutinib significantly reduced atrial fibrillation/flutter versus ibrutinib (7.1% vs 17.0%), with fewer overall cardiac AEs (25.9% vs 35.5%) and zero cardiac‑related deaths versus six on ibrutinib [1]. Head‑to‑head pooled analyses (ASPEN + ALPINE) corroborated reduced AF/flutter with zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib (6.1% vs 15.6%; exposure‑adjusted incidence rate [EAIR] ratio ~0.31) and lower cardiac deaths (0.2% vs 1.7%) [2]. A larger pooled monotherapy analysis also showed low AF/flutter incidence (4.8%; grade ≥3, 2.0%) and rare ventricular arrhythmias (0.7% symptomatic; grade ≥3, 0.4%) [2,3].\n",
    "\n",
    "In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had low AF/flutter incidence (2.6%; two cases had prior AF on covalent BTKi) and low hypertension rates; grade ≥3 cardiac events were uncommon, and exposure‑adjusted rates favored pirtobrutinib versus IdelaR/BR [6]. The US label reports AF/flutter ~3.2% overall (grade ≥3, 1.5%) across pooled datasets, with very low rates of serious ventricular arrhythmias [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Both agents have low atrial arrhythmia rates relative to historical ibrutinib experience. Zanubrutinib’s head‑to‑head data substantiate a substantial reduction in AF/flutter and cardiac deaths versus ibrutinib. Pirtobrutinib shows similarly low AF/flutter in BTKi‑pretreated populations, including patients with prior AF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypertension\n",
    "In ALPINE, hypertension was similar between zanubrutinib and ibrutinib (any grade 27.2% vs 25.3%; grade ≥3 17.0% vs 16.0%), yet cardiac discontinuations and deaths were markedly lower with zanubrutinib [1]. Pooled analyses showed lower or comparable exposure‑adjusted hypertension rates with zanubrutinib and minimal discontinuations due to hypertension [2,3]. In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had lower any‑grade hypertension (6.9%; grade ≥3, 2.6%) than chemotherapy/PI3Ki comparator regimens [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infections (grade ≥3 and fatal)\n",
    "Infections were frequent in ALPINE, in part due to the COVID‑19 era; COVID‑19 infection occurred in 46.0% on zanubrutinib versus 33.3% on ibrutinib, with similar COVID‑19‑related death rates across arms. Grade ≥3 pneumonia was numerically lower with zanubrutinib (7.7% vs 10.5%), and concurrent grade ≥3 neutropenia plus grade ≥3 infection was less frequent (8.3% vs 12.6%) [1]. The US label pooled safety for zanubrutinib reports grade ≥3 infections ~26% and fatal infections ~3% across indications; clinicians should consider prophylaxis in high‑risk patients [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "For pirtobrutinib, pooled safety shows grade ≥3 infections in ~24% overall, with higher rates in CLL/SLL subpopulations (grade ≥3 ~32%; fatal ~8%) reflective of heavy pretreatment and comorbidity. In BRUIN CLL‑321, exposure‑adjusted TEAE rates favored pirtobrutinib versus IdelaR/BR; pneumonia was common but manageable, and discontinuations due to infections were less frequent with pirtobrutinib [6,7].\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Infection risk warrants vigilant monitoring and vaccination strategies for both drugs, especially in older or heavily pretreated patients and during respiratory virus seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bleeding/hemorrhage\n",
    "Class‑typical low‑grade bleeding is common with BTKi. In ALPINE, any‑grade bleeding was similar for zanubrutinib and ibrutinib (43.8% vs 44.4%), with major hemorrhage 4.0% vs 4.9% [1]. Labels advise perioperative holds and caution with antiplatelet/anticoagulants [4]. In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had mostly low‑grade bleeding with three grade 3 hemorrhages; the control arm had one fatal hemorrhage [6]. The pirtobrutinib label reports major hemorrhage ~3% and fatal bleeding ~0.3% across pooled datasets [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cytopenias\n",
    "In ALPINE, neutropenia rates were similar between zanubrutinib and ibrutinib (any grade ~31.5% vs 29.6%; grade ≥3 ~22.8% each), with slightly lower rates of concurrent severe infection plus neutropenia on zanubrutinib [1]. Across pooled datasets, zanubrutinib shows grade 3–4 neutropenia ~21% and thrombocytopenia ~8% [4]. In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had lower grade ≥3 neutropenia versus IdelaR/BR (20.7% vs 27.5%), and exposure‑adjusted incidence ratios favored pirtobrutinib for anemia and neutropenia [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diarrhea\n",
    "Diarrhea was less frequent with zanubrutinib than ibrutinib in ALPINE (18.8% vs 25.6%) [1]. In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had lower diarrhea rates than IdelaR/BR (15.5% vs 31.2%) [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dose modifications, discontinuations, and exposure\n",
    "In ALPINE, median exposure was longer with zanubrutinib (41.2 months vs 37.8 months). Dose interruptions were similar (59.3% vs 62.0%), but dose reductions (14.8% vs 18.2%) and discontinuations due to adverse events (21.4% vs 28.3%) were lower for zanubrutinib; discontinuations due to cardiac AEs were rare (0.9% vs 4.9%) [1]. Pooled analyses across trials corroborate fewer discontinuations and deaths and more patients remaining on zanubrutinib compared with ibrutinib [2,3].\n",
    "\n",
    "In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had fewer discontinuations due to AEs than IdelaR/BR (17.2% vs 34.9%) and fewer dose reductions (11.2% vs 36.7%). Median treatment duration on pirtobrutinib (approximately 15 months) exceeded that on IdelaR/BR, consistent with PFS and TTNT benefits [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subgroup analyses\n",
    "### Prior covalent BTKi and/or BCL2 inhibitor exposure\n",
    "ALPINE excluded prior BTKi exposure and therefore informs BTKi‑naïve R/R practice [1]. BRUIN phase 1/2 showed pirtobrutinib retains high activity after covalent BTKi, with median PFS 22.1 months in BTKi‑pretreated, venetoclax‑naïve patients, and 16.8 months after prior venetoclax; heavily pretreated patients (BTKi + BCL2i + PI3Ki + chemoimmunotherapy) had shorter PFS (~13.8 months) [5]. BRUIN CLL‑321 confirmed superiority versus IdelaR/BR across prior venetoclax strata [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "### BTK C481 mutation\n",
    "Pirtobrutinib retained activity regardless of BTK C481 mutation status in BRUIN, with similar PFS (~17.5–20 months) and robust ORR including PR‑L. PLCG2 mutations were associated with lower ORR (~56% including PR‑L) [5]. As a covalent BTKi, zanubrutinib’s activity is compromised by BTK C481 mutations; ALPINE did not enroll BTKi‑pretreated patients, and clinical use post‑C481 mutation is mechanistically unfavorable [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### del(17p)/TP53 abnormality\n",
    "In ALPINE, zanubrutinib maintained PFS benefit versus ibrutinib in del[17p]/TP53‑abnormal disease (HR 0.51) [1]. BRUIN CLL‑321 showed pirtobrutinib PFS benefits in del[17p]/TP53‑abnormal subgroups (HR 0.59), indicating consistent performance in genomically high‑risk disease [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "### IGHV mutation status and complex karyotype\n",
    "ALPINE did not report IGHV stratification in the final analysis [1]. BRUIN CLL‑321 demonstrated pirtobrutinib PFS benefit in unmutated IGHV (HR 0.61) and complex karyotype (HR 0.37), supporting efficacy across adverse biology [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "### BTKi intolerance versus resistance\n",
    "A dedicated BRUIN intolerance cohort showed that pirtobrutinib is well tolerated in BTKi‑intolerant patients, including those who discontinued covalent BTKi for cardiac AEs. The ORR was ~77% and median PFS ~28.4 months; notably, no patient discontinued pirtobrutinib for the same AE that led to prior BTKi discontinuation, and 75% had no recurrence of the same intolerance [13]. ALPINE did not include BTKi‑intolerant rescue cohorts; however, zanubrutinib reduced AF/flutter versus ibrutinib among BTKi‑naïve R/R patients [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sequencing after covalent BTKi and venetoclax\n",
    "After covalent BTKi failure (including BTK C481 mutations), pirtobrutinib is the preferred BTK‑targeted therapy based on mechanism and phase 3 superiority versus IdelaR/BR, with consistent benefits across del[17p]/TP53, unmutated IGHV, complex karyotype, and prior venetoclax subgroups. The TTNT advantage indicates meaningful delay of subsequent therapy in both venetoclax‑naïve and venetoclax‑exposed patients, with a longer delay in venetoclax‑naïve disease [6]. Pirtobrutinib may serve as a bridge to time‑limited venetoclax‑based combinations to achieve deep remissions and potentially undetectable MRD, or to cellular therapies in suitable candidates; emerging phase 3 data in treatment‑naïve disease (CLL‑313/314) support broader use but await peer‑reviewed publication for detailed interpretation [11,14].\n",
    "\n",
    "In BTKi‑naïve R/R patients where a covalent BTKi is indicated, zanubrutinib is favored over ibrutinib due to superior ORR, PFS, and markedly lower atrial fibrillation/flutter and cardiac deaths; this advantage holds in del[17p]/TP53‑abnormal disease [1]. For patients who are BTKi‑intolerant to a covalent agent, pirtobrutinib is an effective and often better tolerated alternative with low recurrence of the same intolerance [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical safety management and label guidance\n",
    "For zanubrutinib, monitor for hemorrhage, infections (including opportunistic), cytopenias, second primary malignancies, and atrial/ventricular arrhythmias; adjust for drug interactions (CYP3A), recommend perioperative holds (3–7 days), and manage hypertension and dermatologic events proactively [4]. For pirtobrutinib, monitor for infections (including opportunistic and severe pneumonia), hemorrhage, cytopenias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, second primary malignancies, and potential hepatotoxicity; avoid warfarin, manage strong CYP3A interactions, and consider dose modifications per label in the event of grade ≥3 toxicities [7]. Vaccination and antimicrobial prophylaxis should be individualized, particularly in older or heavily pretreated patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of cross‑trial comparisons\n",
    "Populations differ substantially: ALPINE enrolled BTKi‑naïve R/R patients, whereas BRUIN CLL‑321 enrolled exclusively BTKi‑pretreated patients with high‑risk genomic features. Comparators vary (ibrutinib vs IdelaR/BR), crossover in CLL‑321 confounds OS, and COVID‑19 era effects influence infection patterns. Imaging schedules, response assessment timing, and censoring rules differ, limiting direct comparisons of ORR, DOR, PFS medians, and safety rates. Conclusions therefore emphasize within‑trial effects and mechanistic suitability rather than asserting cross‑agent superiority.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "For BTK‑pretreated and double‑refractory CLL/SLL, pirtobrutinib offers superior disease control versus idelalisib+rituximab or bendamustine+rituximab and retains activity in BTK C481‑mutated disease, with consistent benefits across del[17p]/TP53, unmutated IGHV, and complex karyotype. It meaningfully prolongs time to next treatment and has low rates of atrial arrhythmias and manageable cytopenias and infections, making it the preferred BTK‑targeted therapy after covalent BTKi failure [5,6]. In BTKi‑intolerant patients, pirtobrutinib provides effective disease control with low recurrence of the inciting intolerance [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "For BTKi‑naïve R/R CLL/SLL, zanubrutinib demonstrates higher response rates, superior PFS (including in del[17p]/TP53), and markedly fewer atrial fibrillation/flutter events and cardiac deaths than ibrutinib, with longer treatment persistence and fewer discontinuations. These data support zanubrutinib as a preferred covalent BTKi over ibrutinib in this setting [1–3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequencing implications are mechanistically straightforward: after covalent BTKi progression—especially with BTK C481 mutations—use pirtobrutinib; consider transitioning to time‑limited venetoclax‑based combinations or cellular therapies as appropriate. In BTKi‑naïve relapsed patients where a covalent BTKi is indicated, use zanubrutinib rather than ibrutinib for efficacy and cardiovascular safety. Ongoing phase 3 trials (CLL‑313/314) will clarify pirtobrutinib’s role in earlier lines, but current peer‑reviewed evidence already delineates complementary roles for zanubrutinib and pirtobrutinib across the relapse landscape.\n",

       "# Comparative efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib versus pirtobrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (as of November 25, 2025)\n",
       "\n",
       "## Overview and clinical context\n",
       "Relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) has been transformed by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). Among adults who have progressed on or after a covalent BTKi—or who are BTKi‑naïve but require a BTKi in the relapsed setting—the key therapeutic choices now include zanubrutinib, a covalent BTKi optimized for on‑target selectivity and exposure, and pirtobrutinib, a highly selective, reversible (non‑covalent) BTKi designed to retain activity against BTK C481 mutations. As the evidence base matured, distinct clinical niches emerged. Zanubrutinib’s phase 3 head‑to‑head data versus ibrutinib in BTKi‑naïve R/R CLL demonstrate superior efficacy and a favorable cardiovascular profile. Pirtobrutinib’s data in covalent BTKi‑pretreated populations—including randomized superiority versus idelalisib+rituximab or bendamustine+rituximab—establish it as the preferred BTK‑targeted therapy after covalent BTKi failure. Across clinically relevant subgroups (prior BTKi/BCL2 exposure, BTK C481 mutation, del[17p]/TP53 abnormality, IGHV status, BTKi intolerance vs resistance), both agents show consistent disease control with differing strengths that inform sequencing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Direct cross‑trial comparisons are limited by different designs, baseline risks, and follow‑up durations. The synthesis below therefore emphasizes within‑trial comparisons and mechanistic fit, and provides quantitative endpoints where available. Key primary sources include the ALPINE final analysis in Blood for zanubrutinib, pooled cardiovascular safety analyses for zanubrutinib, the BRUIN phase 1/2 NEJM report and JCO phase 3 BRUIN CLL‑321 for pirtobrutinib, and current regulatory labels.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Mechanisms and dosing\n",
       "Zanubrutinib is an irreversible covalent BTKi that binds BTK at Cys481, achieving sustained BTK occupancy with fewer off‑target kinase effects than first‑generation ibrutinib. The recommended dose is 160 mg twice daily (or 320 mg once daily) and therapy is continuous until progression or intolerance. Reduced off‑target inhibition (e.g., CSK, TEC, EGFR family) is associated with lower rates of atrial arrhythmias and selected nonhematologic toxicities seen historically with ibrutinib [1,2,4].\n",
       "\n",
       "Pirtobrutinib is a reversible, non‑covalent BTKi that binds the BTK ATP pocket independent of Cys481, inhibiting both wild‑type and C481‑mutated BTK. The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily; treatment is continuous until progression or intolerance. This design overcomes the dominant covalent BTKi resistance mechanism (BTK C481S/R/Y mutations), while maintaining high BTK selectivity [5,6,7].\n",
       "\n",
       "Mechanistic implication: In patients with BTK C481‑mutated disease after covalent BTKi exposure, pirtobrutinib retains activity. In BTKi‑naïve R/R disease where a covalent BTKi is indicated, zanubrutinib is favored over ibrutinib for efficacy and cardiovascular safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Trial populations and design considerations\n",
       "The phase 3 ALPINE trial (NCT03734016) randomized 652 BTKi‑naïve adults with R/R CLL/SLL to zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib, with a median follow‑up of 42.5 months at the final analysis. No prior BTKi exposure was permitted; there was no crossover. Endpoints included ORR, PFS, OS, and prespecified safety analyses (notably atrial fibrillation/flutter), with subgroup analysis for del[17p]/TP53 [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "Pirtobrutinib’s phase 1/2 BRUIN trial (NCT03740529) established monotherapy activity in advanced B‑cell malignancies; the key CLL/SLL cohort comprised covalent BTKi‑pretreated patients with or without prior venetoclax. Efficacy was assessed per 2018 iwCLL (including PR with lymphocytosis). Additional analyses reported outcomes by BTK C481 mutation, del[17p]/TP53, IGHV status, PLCG2 mutations, and an intolerance cohort [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "The phase 3 BRUIN CLL‑321 (NCT04666038) randomized 238 adults previously treated with a covalent BTKi to pirtobrutinib versus investigator’s choice of idelalisib+rituximab or bendamustine+rituximab (IdelaR/BR). Crossover to pirtobrutinib was allowed upon progression. The primary endpoint was PFS per 2018 iwCLL by independent review; prespecified subgroup analyses included prior venetoclax, del[17p]/TP53, IGHV status, and complex karyotype [6,10].\n",
       "\n",
       "Design differences that constrain direct comparison include BTKi‑naïve versus BTKi‑pretreated populations, distinct control arms (ibrutinib versus IdelaR/BR), allowance for crossover (CLL‑321), and COVID‑19 era effects on infection profiles. Follow‑up durations and assessment schedules also differ.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Efficacy endpoints: quantitative synthesis\n",
       "Across endpoints, pirtobrutinib’s strength is in covalent BTKi‑pretreated disease; zanubrutinib’s strength is in BTKi‑naïve R/R disease versus ibrutinib.\n",

       "### Overall response rate (ORR, including PR‑L per 2018 iwCLL) and CR/CRi\n",
       "In ALPINE, zanubrutinib achieved higher ORR than ibrutinib in BTKi‑naïve R/R CLL/SLL: ORR 85.6% versus 75.4%, with CR/CRi 11.6% versus 7.7%. Including PR‑L or better, rates were 90.2% versus 82.8%. Responses deepened over time [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "In BRUIN phase 1/2 (covalent BTKi‑pretreated CLL/SLL), pirtobrutinib’s ORR was 73.3% (CR 1.6%), and when PR‑L was included, 82.2%. In an expanded dataset, ORR including PR‑L was 81.6% with CR ~1.8% [5]. In the randomized BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib’s ORR including PR‑L was 69% versus 50% with IdelaR/BR [6].\n",

       "In ALPINE, zanubrutinib significantly reduced atrial fibrillation/flutter versus ibrutinib (7.1% vs 17.0%), with fewer overall cardiac AEs (25.9% vs 35.5%) and zero cardiac‑related deaths versus six on ibrutinib [1]. Head‑to‑head pooled analyses (ASPEN + ALPINE) corroborated reduced AF/flutter with zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib (6.1% vs 15.6%; exposure‑adjusted incidence rate [EAIR] ratio ~0.31) and lower cardiac deaths (0.2% vs 1.7%) [2]. A larger pooled monotherapy analysis also showed low AF/flutter incidence (4.8%; grade ≥3, 2.0%) and rare ventricular arrhythmias (0.7% symptomatic; grade ≥3, 0.4%) [2,3].\n",
       "\n",
       "In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had low AF/flutter incidence (2.6%; two cases had prior AF on covalent BTKi) and low hypertension rates; grade ≥3 cardiac events were uncommon, and exposure‑adjusted rates favored pirtobrutinib versus IdelaR/BR [6]. The US label reports AF/flutter ~3.2% overall (grade ≥3, 1.5%) across pooled datasets, with very low rates of serious ventricular arrhythmias [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "Interpretation: Both agents have low atrial arrhythmia rates relative to historical ibrutinib experience. Zanubrutinib’s head‑to‑head data substantiate a substantial reduction in AF/flutter and cardiac deaths versus ibrutinib. Pirtobrutinib shows similarly low AF/flutter in BTKi‑pretreated populations, including patients with prior AF.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Hypertension\n",
       "In ALPINE, hypertension was similar between zanubrutinib and ibrutinib (any grade 27.2% vs 25.3%; grade ≥3 17.0% vs 16.0%), yet cardiac discontinuations and deaths were markedly lower with zanubrutinib [1]. Pooled analyses showed lower or comparable exposure‑adjusted hypertension rates with zanubrutinib and minimal discontinuations due to hypertension [2,3]. In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had lower any‑grade hypertension (6.9%; grade ≥3, 2.6%) than chemotherapy/PI3Ki comparator regimens [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Infections (grade ≥3 and fatal)\n",
       "Infections were frequent in ALPINE, in part due to the COVID‑19 era; COVID‑19 infection occurred in 46.0% on zanubrutinib versus 33.3% on ibrutinib, with similar COVID‑19‑related death rates across arms. Grade ≥3 pneumonia was numerically lower with zanubrutinib (7.7% vs 10.5%), and concurrent grade ≥3 neutropenia plus grade ≥3 infection was less frequent (8.3% vs 12.6%) [1]. The US label pooled safety for zanubrutinib reports grade ≥3 infections ~26% and fatal infections ~3% across indications; clinicians should consider prophylaxis in high‑risk patients [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "For pirtobrutinib, pooled safety shows grade ≥3 infections in ~24% overall, with higher rates in CLL/SLL subpopulations (grade ≥3 ~32%; fatal ~8%) reflective of heavy pretreatment and comorbidity. In BRUIN CLL‑321, exposure‑adjusted TEAE rates favored pirtobrutinib versus IdelaR/BR; pneumonia was common but manageable, and discontinuations due to infections were less frequent with pirtobrutinib [6,7].\n",
       "\n",
       "Interpretation: Infection risk warrants vigilant monitoring and vaccination strategies for both drugs, especially in older or heavily pretreated patients and during respiratory virus seasons.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Bleeding/hemorrhage\n",
       "Class‑typical low‑grade bleeding is common with BTKi. In ALPINE, any‑grade bleeding was similar for zanubrutinib and ibrutinib (43.8% vs 44.4%), with major hemorrhage 4.0% vs 4.9% [1]. Labels advise perioperative holds and caution with antiplatelet/anticoagulants [4]. In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had mostly low‑grade bleeding with three grade 3 hemorrhages; the control arm had one fatal hemorrhage [6]. The pirtobrutinib label reports major hemorrhage ~3% and fatal bleeding ~0.3% across pooled datasets [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Cytopenias\n",
       "In ALPINE, neutropenia rates were similar between zanubrutinib and ibrutinib (any grade ~31.5% vs 29.6%; grade ≥3 ~22.8% each), with slightly lower rates of concurrent severe infection plus neutropenia on zanubrutinib [1]. Across pooled datasets, zanubrutinib shows grade 3–4 neutropenia ~21% and thrombocytopenia ~8% [4]. In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had lower grade ≥3 neutropenia versus IdelaR/BR (20.7% vs 27.5%), and exposure‑adjusted incidence ratios favored pirtobrutinib for anemia and neutropenia [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Diarrhea\n",
       "Diarrhea was less frequent with zanubrutinib than ibrutinib in ALPINE (18.8% vs 25.6%) [1]. In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had lower diarrhea rates than IdelaR/BR (15.5% vs 31.2%) [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Dose modifications, discontinuations, and exposure\n",
       "In ALPINE, median exposure was longer with zanubrutinib (41.2 months vs 37.8 months). Dose interruptions were similar (59.3% vs 62.0%), but dose reductions (14.8% vs 18.2%) and discontinuations due to adverse events (21.4% vs 28.3%) were lower for zanubrutinib; discontinuations due to cardiac AEs were rare (0.9% vs 4.9%) [1]. Pooled analyses across trials corroborate fewer discontinuations and deaths and more patients remaining on zanubrutinib compared with ibrutinib [2,3].\n",
       "\n",
       "In BRUIN CLL‑321, pirtobrutinib had fewer discontinuations due to AEs than IdelaR/BR (17.2% vs 34.9%) and fewer dose reductions (11.2% vs 36.7%). Median treatment duration on pirtobrutinib (approximately 15 months) exceeded that on IdelaR/BR, consistent with PFS and TTNT benefits [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Subgroup analyses\n",
       "### Prior covalent BTKi and/or BCL2 inhibitor exposure\n",
       "ALPINE excluded prior BTKi exposure and therefore informs BTKi‑naïve R/R practice [1]. BRUIN phase 1/2 showed pirtobrutinib retains high activity after covalent BTKi, with median PFS 22.1 months in BTKi‑pretreated, venetoclax‑naïve patients, and 16.8 months after prior venetoclax; heavily pretreated patients (BTKi + BCL2i + PI3Ki + chemoimmunotherapy) had shorter PFS (~13.8 months) [5]. BRUIN CLL‑321 confirmed superiority versus IdelaR/BR across prior venetoclax strata [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "### BTK C481 mutation\n",
       "Pirtobrutinib retained activity regardless of BTK C481 mutation status in BRUIN, with similar PFS (~17.5–20 months) and robust ORR including PR‑L. PLCG2 mutations were associated with lower ORR (~56% including PR‑L) [5]. As a covalent BTKi, zanubrutinib’s activity is compromised by BTK C481 mutations; ALPINE did not enroll BTKi‑pretreated patients, and clinical use post‑C481 mutation is mechanistically unfavorable [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "### del(17p)/TP53 abnormality\n",
       "In ALPINE, zanubrutinib maintained PFS benefit versus ibrutinib in del[17p]/TP53‑abnormal disease (HR 0.51) [1]. BRUIN CLL‑321 showed pirtobrutinib PFS benefits in del[17p]/TP53‑abnormal subgroups (HR 0.59), indicating consistent performance in genomically high‑risk disease [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "### IGHV mutation status and complex karyotype\n",
       "ALPINE did not report IGHV stratification in the final analysis [1]. BRUIN CLL‑321 demonstrated pirtobrutinib PFS benefit in unmutated IGHV (HR 0.61) and complex karyotype (HR 0.37), supporting efficacy across adverse biology [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "### BTKi intolerance versus resistance\n",
       "A dedicated BRUIN intolerance cohort showed that pirtobrutinib is well tolerated in BTKi‑intolerant patients, including those who discontinued covalent BTKi for cardiac AEs. The ORR was ~77% and median PFS ~28.4 months; notably, no patient discontinued pirtobrutinib for the same AE that led to prior BTKi discontinuation, and 75% had no recurrence of the same intolerance [13]. ALPINE did not include BTKi‑intolerant rescue cohorts; however, zanubrutinib reduced AF/flutter versus ibrutinib among BTKi‑naïve R/R patients [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Sequencing after covalent BTKi and venetoclax\n",
       "After covalent BTKi failure (including BTK C481 mutations), pirtobrutinib is the preferred BTK‑targeted therapy based on mechanism and phase 3 superiority versus IdelaR/BR, with consistent benefits across del[17p]/TP53, unmutated IGHV, complex karyotype, and prior venetoclax subgroups. The TTNT advantage indicates meaningful delay of subsequent therapy in both venetoclax‑naïve and venetoclax‑exposed patients, with a longer delay in venetoclax‑naïve disease [6]. Pirtobrutinib may serve as a bridge to time‑limited venetoclax‑based combinations to achieve deep remissions and potentially undetectable MRD, or to cellular therapies in suitable candidates; emerging phase 3 data in treatment‑naïve disease (CLL‑313/314) support broader use but await peer‑reviewed publication for detailed interpretation [11,14].\n",
       "\n",
       "In BTKi‑naïve R/R patients where a covalent BTKi is indicated, zanubrutinib is favored over ibrutinib due to superior ORR, PFS, and markedly lower atrial fibrillation/flutter and cardiac deaths; this advantage holds in del[17p]/TP53‑abnormal disease [1]. For patients who are BTKi‑intolerant to a covalent agent, pirtobrutinib is an effective and often better tolerated alternative with low recurrence of the same intolerance [13].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Practical safety management and label guidance\n",
       "For zanubrutinib, monitor for hemorrhage, infections (including opportunistic), cytopenias, second primary malignancies, and atrial/ventricular arrhythmias; adjust for drug interactions (CYP3A), recommend perioperative holds (3–7 days), and manage hypertension and dermatologic events proactively [4]. For pirtobrutinib, monitor for infections (including opportunistic and severe pneumonia), hemorrhage, cytopenias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, second primary malignancies, and potential hepatotoxicity; avoid warfarin, manage strong CYP3A interactions, and consider dose modifications per label in the event of grade ≥3 toxicities [7]. Vaccination and antimicrobial prophylaxis should be individualized, particularly in older or heavily pretreated patients.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Limitations of cross‑trial comparisons\n",
       "Populations differ substantially: ALPINE enrolled BTKi‑naïve R/R patients, whereas BRUIN CLL‑321 enrolled exclusively BTKi‑pretreated patients with high‑risk genomic features. Comparators vary (ibrutinib vs IdelaR/BR), crossover in CLL‑321 confounds OS, and COVID‑19 era effects influence infection patterns. Imaging schedules, response assessment timing, and censoring rules differ, limiting direct comparisons of ORR, DOR, PFS medians, and safety rates. Conclusions therefore emphasize within‑trial effects and mechanistic suitability rather than asserting cross‑agent superiority.\n",

       "## Conclusion\n",
       "For BTK‑pretreated and double‑refractory CLL/SLL, pirtobrutinib offers superior disease control versus idelalisib+rituximab or bendamustine+rituximab and retains activity in BTK C481‑mutated disease, with consistent benefits across del[17p]/TP53, unmutated IGHV, and complex karyotype. It meaningfully prolongs time to next treatment and has low rates of atrial arrhythmias and manageable cytopenias and infections, making it the preferred BTK‑targeted therapy after covalent BTKi failure [5,6]. In BTKi‑intolerant patients, pirtobrutinib provides effective disease control with low recurrence of the inciting intolerance [13].\n",
       "\n",
       "For BTKi‑naïve R/R CLL/SLL, zanubrutinib demonstrates higher response rates, superior PFS (including in del[17p]/TP53), and markedly fewer atrial fibrillation/flutter events and cardiac deaths than ibrutinib, with longer treatment persistence and fewer discontinuations. These data support zanubrutinib as a preferred covalent BTKi over ibrutinib in this setting [1–3].\n",
       "\n",
       "Sequencing implications are mechanistically straightforward: after covalent BTKi progression—especially with BTK C481 mutations—use pirtobrutinib; consider transitioning to time‑limited venetoclax‑based combinations or cellular therapies as appropriate. In BTKi‑naïve relapsed patients where a covalent BTKi is indicated, use zanubrutinib rather than ibrutinib for efficacy and cardiovascular safety. Ongoing phase 3 trials (CLL‑313/314) will clarify pirtobrutinib’s role in earlier lines, but current peer‑reviewed evidence already delineates complementary roles for zanubrutinib and pirtobrutinib across the relapse landscape.\n",
