# Comparative efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib versus pirtobrutinib in US adults with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (as of December 2025)

## Scope and key questions
This report compares the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib (a covalent BTK inhibitor) and pirtobrutinib (a non‑covalent BTK inhibitor) for adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in the United States. It prioritizes progression‑free survival (PFS) and evaluates overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), time to next treatment (TTNT), and minimal residual disease (MRD) when reported. Safety comparisons include overall and grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuation and dose modification, atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF), other cardiac events, bleeding, hematologic toxicities, hypertension, and infections. Findings are stratified by line of therapy, prior covalent BTK inhibitor (cBTKi) or venetoclax exposure, high‑risk biology (del[17p]/TP53, IGHV status if available), and age/comorbidity subgroups when reported. Where direct head‑to‑head data are lacking, indirect comparisons are made with attention to study design and population differences.

## US indications, dosing, and positioning in practice
Zanubrutinib (Brukinsa) received US approval for CLL/SLL on January 19, 2023. <ref id="3">"On January 19, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved zanubrutinib (Brukinsa, BeiGene USA, Inc.) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)."</ref> The US label recommends 160 mg orally twice daily or 320 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with a reduced dose of 80 mg twice daily for severe hepatic impairment. <ref id="2">"Recommended dosage: 160 mg orally twice daily or 320 mg orally once daily; swallow whole with water and with or without food. (2.1)"</ref><ref id="1">"The recommended dosage of BRUKINSA for patients with severe hepatic impairment is 80 mg orally twice daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."</ref>

Pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca) received accelerated US approval on December 1, 2023 for adults with CLL/SLL after at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL‑2 inhibitor. <ref id="5">"On December 1, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca, Eli Lilly and Company) for adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor."</ref> The recommended dose is 200 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. <ref id="5">"The recommended pirtobrutinib dose is 200 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."</ref>

Within NCCN‑derived educational materials for 2025, first‑line CLL/SLL category 1 options include acalabrutinib ± obinutuzumab, venetoclax + obinutuzumab, and zanubrutinib. <ref id="1">"• Acalabrutinib ± obinutuzumab (category 1)"</ref><ref id="1">"• Venetoclax + obinutuzumab (category 1)"</ref><ref id="1">"• Zanubrutinib (category 1)"</ref> In second‑line and later settings, category 1 options include ibrutinib, venetoclax + rituximab (no del[17p]), acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib; pirtobrutinib is listed as useful for BTKi resistance or intolerance. <ref id="1">"In second-line and later CLL/SLL settings, category 1 regimens include ibrutinib, venetoclax + rituximab (no del[17p]), acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib; pirtobrutinib is useful for BTKi resistance or intolerance."</ref> For multi‑refractory disease after BTKi and BCL‑2 inhibitor exposure, preferred regimens include CAR‑T (liso‑cel) and pirtobrutinib if not previously given. <ref id="1">"Preferred regimens for CLL/SLL with/without del(17p)/TP53 mutation • Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy: liso-cel • Pirtobrutinib (if not previously given)"</ref>

## Mechanisms of action and pharmacologic class context
Zanubrutinib is a next‑generation covalent BTK inhibitor designed for high BTK occupancy and improved selectivity compared with first‑generation agents; its clinical positioning is supported by head‑to‑head efficacy and safety advantages over ibrutinib in R/R CLL/SLL (ALPINE). <ref id="4">"At a median follow-up of 29.6 months, zanubrutinib was superior to ibrutinib with respect to investigator-assessed progression-free survival (87 vs. 118 occurrences of disease progression or death; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.86; P=0.002) (Figure 2A)."</ref>

Pirtobrutinib is a highly selective, non‑covalent (reversible) BTK inhibitor that inhibits both wild‑type and C481‑mutant BTK with equal low‑nanomolar potency, enabling activity after cBTKi failure driven by BTK C481 resistance mutations. <ref id="3">"Pirtobrutinib, a highly selective, non-covalent (reversible) BTKi, inhibits both wildtype and C481-mutant BTK with equal low nM potency, and has favorable oral pharmacology that enables continuous BTK inhibition throughout the dosing interval, regardless of intrinsic rate of BTK turnover."</ref>

## Efficacy evidence in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL

### Zanubrutinib: randomized head‑to‑head data versus ibrutinib (ALPINE)
In the global phase 3 ALPINE trial (R/R CLL/SLL; n=652), zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily demonstrated superior PFS versus ibrutinib 420 mg once daily at a median follow‑up of 29.6 months (HR 0.65). <ref id="4">"Enrolled patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive zanubrutinib at a dose of 160 mg twice daily or ibrutinib at a dose of 420 mg once daily until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects."</ref><ref id="4">"At a median follow-up of 29.6 months, zanubrutinib was superior to ibrutinib with respect to investigator-assessed progression-free survival (87 vs. 118 occurrences of disease progression or death; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.86; P=0.002) (Figure 2A)."</ref> The 24‑month PFS was 78.4% with zanubrutinib versus 65.9% with ibrutinib. <ref id="4">"At 24 months, the percentage of patients with progression-free survival, as assessed by the investigators, was 78.4% (95% CI, 73.3 to 82.7) in the zanubrutinib group and 65.9% (95% CI, 60.1 to 71.1) in the ibrutinib group."</ref> ORR was also higher with zanubrutinib (83.5% vs 74.2%). <ref id="4">"In the final analysis, the percentage of patients in the intention-to-treat population with an overall response, as assessed by the investigators, was higher in the zanubrutinib group than in the ibrutinib group (83.5% and 74.2%)."</ref>

With extended follow‑up of 42.5 months, the PFS benefit was sustained (HR 0.68), with a 36‑month PFS of 65.4% versus 54.4%. <ref id="10">"The PFS benefit for zanubrutinib was sustained over ibrutinib (HR: 0.68 [95% CI, 0.54-0.84]) with a median of 42.5 months follow-up."</ref><ref id="8">"The study, published in Blood, reported that the 36-month PFS rate was 65.4% in the zanubrutinib treatment arm and 54.4% in the ibrutinib treatment arm."</ref> Response depth improved over time, with CR/CRi rates of 11.6% versus 7.7%. <ref id="10">"The CR/CRi rates were 11.6% for zanubrutinib and 7.7% for ibrutinib."</ref> The PFS advantage extended to patients with del(17p)/TP53 alterations (HR 0.51). <ref id="9">"At an overall median follow-up of 42.5 months, progression-free survival benefit with zanubrutinib vs ibrutinib was sustained (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.84), including in patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutation (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33-0.78) and across multiple sensitivity analyses."</ref>

Time‑to‑next‑treatment was not a primary outcome in ALPINE and was not consistently reported across public summaries; thus, no definitive TTNT comparison to pirtobrutinib is available from ALPINE.

### Pirtobrutinib: single‑arm BRUIN and randomized BRUIN CLL‑321
In the phase 1/2 BRUIN study (R/R CLL/SLL; n=317; majority cBTKi‑pretreated), pirtobrutinib produced an ORR of 73.3% (82.2% including PR with lymphocytosis) and a median PFS of 19.6 months. <ref id="5">"A total of 317 patients with CLL or SLL received pirtobrutinib, including 247 who had previously received a BTK inhibitor."</ref><ref id="5">"The percentage of patients with an overall response to pirtobrutinib was 73.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.3 to 78.7), and the percentage was 82.2% (95% CI, 76.8 to 86.7) when partial response with lymphocytosis was included."</ref><ref id="5">"The median progression-free survival was 19.6 months (95% CI, 16.9 to 22.1)."</ref>

In the randomized, open‑label BRUIN CLL‑321 trial (post‑cBTKi), pirtobrutinib monotherapy improved PFS versus investigator’s choice of idelalisib + rituximab or bendamustine + rituximab: median 14.0 versus 8.7 months (HR 0.54), at a median follow‑up of 17.2 months. <ref id="7">"The PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.75; P = .0002), with a median PFS of 14 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 16.6) in the pirtobrutinib group and 8.7 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.4) with IC."</ref><ref id="1">"Median follow-up was 17.2 months."</ref> TTNT was also significantly longer: 24.0 versus 10.9 months (HR 0.37). <ref id="1">"The median TTNT was longer with pirtobrutinib vs IdelaR/BR (24 months vs 10.9 months; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25–0.52)."</ref> Investigator‑assessed ORR (including PR‑L) was 69% versus 50% for the control arm. <ref id="7">"Investigator-assessed ORR, including partial response with lymphocytosis, was higher in the pirtobrutinib group (69% [95% CI, 60 to 77]) versus IdelaR/BR (50% [95% CI, 40 to 59])."</ref> Effective crossover from control to pirtobrutinib occurred in 76% of eligible patients after progression, potentially diluting OS differences. <ref id="7">"Of 66 patients on IdelaR/BR who experienced PD as assessed by INV, 50 with IRC-confirmed PD who met iwCLL criteria for requiring treatment crossed over to receive pirtobrutinib, for an effective crossover rate of 76% (n = 50/66)."</ref>

## Safety and tolerability profiles

### Zanubrutinib
In ALPINE, zanubrutinib had a lower incidence of any‑grade AF/flutter (5.2% vs 13.3%), fewer cardiac disorders overall (21.3% vs 29.6%), and fewer discontinuations due to AEs (15.4% vs 22.2%) than ibrutinib. <ref id="4">"The incidence of atrial fibrillation or flutter (a key secondary outcome) of any grade was lower in the zanubrutinib group than in the ibrutinib group (in 17 of 324 patients [5.2%] and in 43 of 324 patients [13.3%])."</ref><ref id="4">"Overall, a lower incidence of cardiac disorders was reported in the zanubrutinib group (21.3%) than in the ibrutinib group (29.6%) (Figure 3A)."</ref><ref id="4">"Events leading to treatment discontinuation | 50 (15.4) | 72 (22.2)"</ref> With longer follow‑up, AF/flutter remained lower (7.1% vs 17.0%), with fewer cardiac events (25.9% vs 35.5%) and no cardiac deaths on zanubrutinib versus six with ibrutinib, despite similar hypertension rates. <ref id="8">"Overall cardiac events remained considerably lower with zanubrutinib compared with ibrutinib and the rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter was lower with zanubrutinib vs ibrutinib (7.1% vs 17.0%) despite similar hypertension rates."</ref><ref id="9">"Cardiac events were lower with zanubrutinib (25.9% vs 35.5%) despite similar rates of hypertension."</ref><ref id="9">"Incidence of atrial fibrillation/flutter was lower with zanubrutinib vs ibrutinib (7.1% vs 17.0%); no cardiac deaths were reported with zanubrutinib vs 6 cardiac deaths with ibrutinib."</ref>

From the US label pooled safety population, key warnings include hemorrhage with grade ≥3 events in 3.8% (fatal 0.2%), serious infections with grade ≥3 events in 26% (fatal 3.2%), and atrial fibrillation/flutter in 4.4%. <ref id="2">"Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and hemothorax was reported in 3.8% of patients treated with BRUKINSA in clinical trials, with fatalities occurring in 0.2% of patients."</ref><ref id="2">"Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 26% of patients, most commonly pneumonia (7.9%), with fatal infections occurring in 3.2% of patients."</ref><ref id="12">"Atrial fibrillation or flutter was reported in 3.7% and Grade 3 or higher ventricular arrhythmias in 0.2% of patients treated with zanubrutinib."</ref>

### Pirtobrutinib
In BRUIN (phase 1/2), commonly observed AEs included infections (71%), bleeding (42.6%), and neutropenia (32.5%); grade ≥3 infections occurred in 28.1% and grade ≥3 neutropenia in 26.8%. <ref id="5">"Among all 317 patients, the most common adverse events were infections (71.0%), bleeding (42.6%), and neutropenia (32.5%); grade ≥3 infections and neutropenia occurred in 28.1% and 26.8%, respectively."</ref> AF/flutter (3.8%), major hemorrhage (2.2%), and hypertension (14.2%) were infrequent, and 2.8% discontinued for treatment‑related AEs. <ref id="5">"Hypertension (14.2%), atrial fibrillation/flutter (3.8%), and major hemorrhage (2.2%) were infrequent, and only 2.8% discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events."</ref>

In BRUIN CLL‑321, grade ≥3 treatment‑emergent AEs were lower with pirtobrutinib (57.7%) than with idelalisib/rituximab or bendamustine/rituximab (73.4%), and discontinuations due to AEs were less frequent (17.2% vs 34.9%). <ref id="1">"The pirtobrutinib group showed lower rates of Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (57.7% vs 73.4%) and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (17.2% vs 34.9%) compared with the IdelaR/BR group."</ref> The pirtobrutinib US label further notes major hemorrhage in 3% (fatal 0.3%) and grade ≥3 infections in 24% (fatal 4.4%) in the pooled safety population. <ref id="6">"Major hemorrhage (defined as Grade 3 or higher bleeding or any central nervous system bleeding) occurred in 3% of 593 patients treated with JAYPIRCA, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage; fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.3% of patients."</ref><ref id="6">"In the clinical trial, Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 24% of 593 patients, most commonly pneumonia (14%), with fatal infections occurring in 4.4% of patients."</ref>

## Stratified findings by setting, prior therapies, risk biology, and age/comorbidity

Prior BTK inhibitor and venetoclax exposure strongly influence clinical choices. Pirtobrutinib has randomized evidence specifically after cBTKi exposure and is FDA‑authorized after prior BTKi and BCL‑2 inhibitor in the US. <ref id="7">"The PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.75; P = .0002), with a median PFS of 14 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 16.6) in the pirtobrutinib group and 8.7 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.4) with IC."</ref><ref id="5">"On December 1, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca, Eli Lilly and Company) for adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor."</ref> In BRUIN, median PFS was longer in patients without prior BCL‑2 inhibitor exposure (23.0 months) than in those previously exposed (15.9 months), supporting a role earlier in the post‑cBTKi sequence when BCL‑2 therapy is still ahead. <ref id="3">"In the phase 1/2 BRUIN study, pirtobrutinib demonstrated promising durable overall response rates (ORR) and was well tolerated in patients with CLL/SLL regardless of prior therapy (including cBTKi), number of prior lines of therapy, BTK C481 mutation status, or reason for prior cBTKi discontinuation."</ref>

For high‑risk biology, zanubrutinib’s superiority over ibrutinib extends to del(17p)/TP53 subgroups (HR 0.51), strengthening its position among covalent BTKi options for genetically high‑risk R/R disease. <ref id="9">"At an overall median follow-up of 42.5 months, progression-free survival benefit with zanubrutinib vs ibrutinib was sustained (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.84), including in patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutation (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33-0.78) and across multiple sensitivity analyses."</ref> IGHV‑stratified outcomes are not consistently reported across these BTK monotherapy trials; however, in practice materials, second‑generation BTK inhibitors such as zanubrutinib are favored in unmutated IGHV or TP53‑aberrant disease contexts. <ref id="5">"Dr Stephens said that for patients with an unmutated copy of IGHV, with del17p or TP53, a good approach is to move them toward second-generation BTK inhibitors (eg, acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib)."</ref>

Older age is common in CLL; zanubrutinib’s broader development program included many older patients.

Cardiac comorbidity often influences BTK inhibitor choice. In ALPINE, no cardiac deaths occurred with zanubrutinib versus six in the ibrutinib arm, and AF/flutter was consistently lower with zanubrutinib, informing selection in patients at AF risk. <ref id="5">"None of the patients in the zanubrutinib group died from a heart-related issue, whereas six patients in the ibrutinib group had a fatal cardiac event."</ref><ref id="4">"The incidence of atrial fibrillation or flutter (a key secondary outcome) of any grade was lower in the zanubrutinib group than in the ibrutinib group (in 17 of 324 patients [5.2%] and in 43 of 324 patients [13.3%])."</ref>

## Study design differences affecting indirect comparisons
Cross‑trial comparisons between zanubrutinib and pirtobrutinib must be interpreted cautiously due to differences in comparators, prior therapy exposure, and follow‑up. ALPINE compared zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in R/R CLL/SLL and enrolled many BTKi‑naïve patients, with follow‑up now beyond 42 months. <ref id="4">"Enrolled patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive zanubrutinib at a dose of 160 mg twice daily or ibrutinib at a dose of 420 mg once daily until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects."</ref><ref id="10">"The PFS benefit for zanubrutinib was sustained over ibrutinib (HR: 0.68 [95% CI, 0.54-0.84]) with a median of 42.5 months follow-up."</ref> By contrast, BRUIN CLL‑321 enrolled exclusively cBTKi‑pretreated patients and used chemoimmunotherapy or PI3K‑based control arms, with median follow‑up of 17.2 months and substantial crossover to pirtobrutinib at progression. <ref id="1">"The open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III BRUIN CLL-321 trial (NCT04666038) assessed the efficacy and safety of pirtobrutinib (n = 119) vs investigator’s choice of idelalisib + rituximab (n = 82) or bendamustine + rituximab (n = 37) in patients with CLL/SLL who were previously treated with cBTKis."</ref><ref id="1">"Median follow-up was 17.2 months."</ref><ref id="7">"Of 66 patients on IdelaR/BR who experienced PD as assessed by INV, 50 with IRC-confirmed PD who met iwCLL criteria for requiring treatment crossed over to receive pirtobrutinib, for an effective crossover rate of 76% (n = 50/66)."</ref> These differences preclude valid indirect estimation of superiority between zanubrutinib and pirtobrutinib; rather, they support complementary roles at different points in the US treatment sequence.

## Practical implications for US treatment sequencing
In R/R patients without prior BTKi, covalent BTK inhibitors remain standard options; within this class, zanubrutinib offers superior PFS and a more favorable cardiac safety profile versus ibrutinib in R/R CLL/SLL. <ref id="4">"At a median follow-up of 29.6 months, zanubrutinib was superior to ibrutinib with respect to investigator-assessed progression-free survival (87 vs. 118 occurrences of disease progression or death; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.86; P=0.002) (Figure 2A)."</ref><ref id="4">"The incidence of atrial fibrillation or flutter (a key secondary outcome) of any grade was lower in the zanubrutinib group than in the ibrutinib group (in 17 of 324 patients [5.2%] and in 43 of 324 patients [13.3%])."</ref> After prior cBTKi exposure, pirtobrutinib provides randomized PFS and TTNT advantages versus idelalisib/rituximab or bendamustine/rituximab, with fewer grade ≥3 AEs and discontinuations. <ref id="7">"The PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.75; P = .0002), with a median PFS of 14 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 16.6) in the pirtobrutinib group and 8.7 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.4) with IC."</ref><ref id="1">"The median TTNT was longer with pirtobrutinib vs IdelaR/BR (24 months vs 10.9 months; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25–0.52)."</ref><ref id="1">"The pirtobrutinib group showed lower rates of Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (57.7% vs 73.4%) and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (17.2% vs 34.9%) compared with the IdelaR/BR group."</ref> In multi‑refractory patients previously treated with both BTKi and venetoclax, pirtobrutinib has an FDA‑authorized role; CAR‑T therapy (liso‑cel) is an additional NCCN‑listed option for appropriate candidates. <ref id="5">"On December 1, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca, Eli Lilly and Company) for adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor."</ref><ref id="1">"Preferred regimens for CLL/SLL with/without del(17p)/TP53 mutation • Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy: liso-cel • Pirtobrutinib (if not previously given)"</ref>

## Safety class effects and label‑level cautions relevant in US practice
Zanubrutinib carries class warnings for hemorrhage, serious infections, cytopenias, second primary malignancies, and cardiac arrhythmias, with label‑reported grade ≥3 hemorrhage in 3.8% (fatal 0.2%) and grade ≥3 infections in 26% (fatal 3.2%). <ref id="2">"Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and hemothorax was reported in 3.8% of patients treated with BRUKINSA in clinical trials, with fatalities occurring in 0.2% of patients."</ref><ref id="2">"Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 26% of patients, most commonly pneumonia (7.9%), with fatal infections occurring in 3.2% of patients."</ref> Pirtobrutinib labeling identifies major hemorrhage in 3% (fatal 0.3%) and grade ≥3 infections in 24% (fatal 4.4%) in pooled clinical experience. <ref id="6">"Major hemorrhage (defined as Grade 3 or higher bleeding or any central nervous system bleeding) occurred in 3% of 593 patients treated with JAYPIRCA, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage; fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.3% of patients."</ref><ref id="6">"In the clinical trial, Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 24% of 593 patients, most commonly pneumonia (14%), with fatal infections occurring in 4.4% of patients."</ref> These data underscore the importance of infection prophylaxis/monitoring, bleeding risk mitigation, and cardiac assessment when selecting among BTK inhibitors in US practice.

## Conclusions
- In R/R CLL/SLL without prior BTKi, zanubrutinib offers superior PFS and improved cardiac safety compared with ibrutinib, with sustained benefit into high‑risk del(17p)/TP53 subgroups and lower AF/flutter and cardiac events over long‑term follow‑up. <ref id="4">"At a median follow-up of 29.6 months, zanubrutinib was superior to ibrutinib with respect to investigator-assessed progression-free survival (87 vs. 118 occurrences of disease progression or death; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.86; P=0.002) (Figure 2A)."</ref><ref id="9">"At an overall median follow-up of 42.5 months, progression-free survival benefit with zanubrutinib vs ibrutinib was sustained (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.84), including in patients with del(17p)/TP53 mutation (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33-0.78) and across multiple sensitivity analyses."</ref><ref id="8">"Overall cardiac events remained considerably lower with zanubrutinib compared with ibrutinib and the rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter was lower with zanubrutinib vs ibrutinib (7.1% vs 17.0%) despite similar hypertension rates."</ref>
- In the post‑cBTKi setting, pirtobrutinib demonstrates significant improvements in PFS and TTNT against idelalisib/rituximab or bendamustine/rituximab controls, with fewer grade ≥3 AEs and discontinuations; it is FDA‑authorized after both BTKi and venetoclax and is recognized in NCCN‑derived materials as a preferred option in multi‑refractory disease if not previously given. <ref id="7">"The PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.75; P = .0002), with a median PFS of 14 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 16.6) in the pirtobrutinib group and 8.7 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.4) with IC."</ref><ref id="1">"The median TTNT was longer with pirtobrutinib vs IdelaR/BR (24 months vs 10.9 months; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25–0.52)."</ref><ref id="1">"The pirtobrutinib group showed lower rates of Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (57.7% vs 73.4%) and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (17.2% vs 34.9%) compared with the IdelaR/BR group."</ref><ref id="5">"On December 1, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca, Eli Lilly and Company) for adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor."</ref><ref id="1">"Preferred regimens for CLL/SLL with/without del(17p)/TP53 mutation • Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy: liso-cel • Pirtobrutinib (if not previously given)"</ref>
- There is no head‑to‑head trial of zanubrutinib versus pirtobrutinib; their roles are complementary in US practice: zanubrutinib is a preferred covalent BTKi in earlier R/R lines, and pirtobrutinib is an active, well‑tolerated option after cBTKi (and per FDA label, after both BTKi and venetoclax), with randomized evidence against non‑BTKi controls. <ref id="1">"• Zanubrutinib (category 1)"</ref><ref id="1">"In second-line and later CLL/SLL settings, category 1 regimens include ibrutinib, venetoclax + rituximab (no del[17p]), acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib; pirtobrutinib is useful for BTKi resistance or intolerance."</ref><ref id="7">"The PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.75; P = .0002), with a median PFS of 14 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 16.6) in the pirtobrutinib group and 8.7 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.4) with IC."</ref>
