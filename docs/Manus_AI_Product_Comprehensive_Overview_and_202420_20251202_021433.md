# Manus (AI Product): Comprehensive Overview and 2024–2025 Update

## Correct Identification and Company Behind Manus

Manus is an autonomous AI agent product officially branded on its website as “Manus: Hands On AI,” and it is operated by Butterfly Effect Pte. Ltd. as stated in the product’s privacy policy. The corporate identity on the official site footer indicates Singapore, and the company discloses offices in Singapore, San Mateo (California), and Tokyo. External reporting in 2025 similarly noted the Singapore headquarters, with coverage of its invite-only launch in early March. These details establish the correct entity and location for the AI product and differentiate it from other organizations with similar names. [1a](https://manus.im/#:~:text=Manus:%20Hands%20On,Hands%20On%20AI)[2a](https://manus.im/privacy#:~:text=Butterfly%20Effect%20Pte.%20Ltd.,platforms%20-%20Manus%20AI)[3](https://manus.im/about)[4](https://manus.im/careers#:~:text=Today%20we're%20growing,and%20Tokyo)[21a](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3317568/chinese-firm-behind-ai-agent-manus-relocates-singapore-amid-us-chip-curbs#:~:text=This%20company%20right%20now%20is,on%20June%2018)[21b](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3317568/chinese-firm-behind-ai-agent-manus-relocates-singapore-amid-us-chip-curbs)

To avoid confusion with similarly named entities, it is important to note that MANUS (VR/data gloves) is a separate Dutch hardware company that explicitly states it is not Manus AI; manusai.ai is a fan site unrelated to the official product; and “Openmanus” (manus-ai.com) is a different U.S.-based site with its own history and policies. [31](https://www.manus-vr.com/contact-manus#:~:text=We%20are%20NOT%20Manus%20AI,invitation%20codes)[32](https://manusai.ai/blog#:~:text=Disclaimer:%20This%20is%20a%20fan-made,created%20by%20AI%20enthusiasts)[33](https://manus-ai.com/about#:~:text=After%20months%20of%20research%20and,launched%20in%20early%202024)[34](https://manus-ai.com/privacy)

## Purpose and Core Capabilities

Manus positions itself as a general autonomous AI agent that completes tasks and delivers results rather than simply answering questions. It operates in a full virtual environment with internet access and a persistent file system, functioning as a virtual colleague capable of planning, executing, and delivering complete work products. The platform highlights end‑to‑end capabilities such as generating entire slide decks from a single prompt, turning files into engaging websites, transforming web development into a seamless conversational workflow, and executing tasks asynchronously in the cloud so users can close devices and receive notifications upon completion. In addition, Manus scales research through multi‑agent parallelization under its “Wide Research” paradigm. [7a](https://manus.im/docs/introduction/welcome#:~:text=Manus%20AI%20is%20an%20autonomous,deliver%20results)[7b](https://manus.im/docs/introduction/welcome#:~:text=It%20operates%20in%20a%20complete,create%20custom%20tools)[7c](https://manus.im/docs/introduction/welcome#:~:text=Think%20of%20Manus%20AI%20as,start%20to%20finish)[5a](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/manus-ai/id6740909540#:~:text=With%20a%20single%20prompt,tailored%20to%20your%20needs)[5b](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/manus-ai/id6740909540#:~:text=Manus%20turns%20any%20file%20into,with%20one%20prompt)[8a](https://manus.im/docs/website-builder/getting-started#:~:text=Manus%20transforms%20web%20development%20from,conversational%20workflow)[5c](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/manus-ai/id6740909540#:~:text=Manus%20works%20asynchronously%20in%20the,task%20is%20complete)[11a](https://manus.im/blog/introducing-wide-research#:~:text=At%20its%20core,agent-to-agent%20collaboration)

## Underlying Models and Technology

Manus is architected as an autonomous agent system with a managed sandbox capable of installing software and creating tools, enabling independent completion of complex workflows. It implements multi‑agent parallelization through Wide Research, in which each sub‑agent is a fully capable general‑purpose Manus instance, rather than a fixed role‑based agent. The platform integrates with third‑party AI providers to generate outputs in response to user inputs, and the blog’s discussion of token pricing suggests Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet is among the models considered or used in the system. [7d](https://manus.im/docs/introduction/welcome#:~:text=It%20operates%20in%20a%20complete,create%20custom%20tools)[11b](https://manus.im/blog/introducing-wide-research#:~:text=Unlike%20traditional%20multi-agent%20systems,general-purpose%20Manus%20instance)[2b](https://manus.im/privacy#:~:text=Parts%20of%20the%20Service%20are,inputs%20and%20prompts)[10a](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus#:~:text=And%20we're%20not%20talking%20about,a%2010x%20difference)

Programmatically, Manus exposes APIs and webhooks to create and monitor tasks, including detailed retrieval of task status, outputs, credit usage, and metadata.

[23a](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/integrations#:~:text=Integrations%20allow%20Manus%20to%20connect,Calendar%20and%20more)[23b](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/integrations#:~:text=Available%20connectors%20include,and%20more)[25](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/zapier#:~:text=Manus%20for%20Zapier%20allows%20you,no-code%20workflows)[26](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/slack-integration#:~:text=Manus%20for%20Slack%20brings%20AI,team%20conversations)[24](https://open.manus.im/docs/connectors#:~:text=Connectors%20link%20Manus%20to%20your,and%20Notion)[8b](https://manus.im/docs/website-builder/getting-started#:~:text=Integrate%20and%20Extend:%20Connect%20to,location-based%20features)

## Data Privacy and Security Posture

Butterfly Effect Pte. Ltd. provides the Manus AI platform and publishes a privacy policy describing processing of personal information collected through the Manus AI platform and related mobile apps and browser extensions. The service integrates third‑party AI providers for output generation, and enforces sandbox‑specific retention policies that separate sandbox data from regular sessions, with automatic deletion after 7 days on free plans and 14 days on paid plans unless the sandbox is reset. Manus’ User Safety & Content Policy states that user content is not used to train a Manus foundation model and the company endeavors to disable third‑party training on user data. The company asserts SOC 2 and GDPR compliance, and its Trust Center documents specific controls and attestations, including SOC 2 Type 1 and GDPR, with security measures such as data encryption and the ability to view subprocessors. [2a](https://manus.im/privacy#:~:text=Butterfly%20Effect%20Pte.%20Ltd.,platforms%20-%20Manus%20AI)[2c](https://manus.im/privacy#:~:text=This%20Privacy%20Policy%20describes%20how,browser%20extensions%20related%20to%20Manus%20AI)[2b](https://manus.im/privacy#:~:text=Parts%20of%20the%20Service%20are,inputs%20and%20prompts)[2e](https://manus.im/privacy#:~:text=Sandbox%20data%20is%20stored%20separately,Sandbox%20is%20reset)[16](https://manus.im/content-policy#:~:text=We%20do%20not%20use%20your,on%20your%20data)[13e](https://manus.im/team#:~:text=We%20are%20SOC%202%20and,GDPR%20compliant)[14a](https://trust.manus.im/#:~:text=SOC%202%20Type%201,Type%201)[14b](https://trust.manus.im/#:~:text=GDPR,GDPR)[14c](https://trust.manus.im/#:~:text=Data%20encryption%20utilized,encryption%20utilized)[14d](https://trust.manus.im/)

Operationally, Manus provides a Cloud Browser feature to securely manage login states across agent sandboxes, encrypts and saves login information such as cookies and local storage data, and allows users to delete all cookies and website data across devices and sandboxes with a single action. [12a](https://manus.im/help/cloud-browser)[12b](https://manus.im/help/cloud-browser)

## Key Differentiators Versus Comparable AI Products

Manus differentiates itself through end‑to‑end autonomy with persistent compute, asynchronous cloud execution, native full‑stack web and app creation, and multi‑agent parallelization. The sandbox environment gives the agent a virtual computer capable of installing software and creating custom tools, enabling it to deliver production‑ready results independently. Asynchronous execution allows tasks to continue in the cloud, notifying users upon completion, which aligns with modern knowledge work patterns. The website builder reframes development as a singular conversational workflow from research and content creation through deployment and analytics. Its Wide Research framework provides system‑level parallel processing and agent‑to‑agent collaboration, and Projects introduce reusable workflows with shared instructions, knowledge, and tools for teams. [7e](https://manus.im/docs/introduction/welcome#:~:text=It%20operates%20in%20a%20complete,create%20custom%20tools)[5e](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/manus-ai/id6740909540#:~:text=Manus%20works%20asynchronously%20in%20the,task%20is%20complete)[8c](https://manus.im/docs/website-builder/getting-started#:~:text=It%20is%20not%20just%20a,post-launch%20analytics)[11c](https://manus.im/blog/introducing-wide-research#:~:text=At%20its%20core,agent-to-agent%20collaboration)[10d](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus)

Performance iteration in 2025 focused on speed and quality improvements, with Manus 1.5 reducing average task completion time from 15 minutes in April to under 4 minutes and improving internal task quality by 15% compared to earlier versions. These improvements support production‑grade use cases requiring timely, reliable outputs.
