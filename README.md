# Deep Research

Deep research has broken out as one of the most popular agent applications. This is a simple, configurable, fully open source deep research agent that works across many model providers, search tools, and MCP servers.

* See our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agGiWUpxkhg) for a quick overview

### 🚀 Quickstart

1. Clone the repository and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research.git
cd open_deep_research
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

3. Set up your `.env` file to customize the environment variables (for model selection, search tools, and other configuration settings):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Launch the assistant with the LangGraph server locally to open LangGraph Studio in your browser:

```bash
# Install dependencies and start the LangGraph server
uvx --refresh --from "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --with-editable . --python 3.11 langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```

Use this to open the Studio UI:

### Configurations

Deep Research offers extensive configuration options to customize the research process and model behavior. All configurations can be set via the web UI, environment variables, or by modifying the configuration directly.

#### General Settings

- **Max Structured Output Retries** (default: 3): Maximum number of retries for structured output calls from models when parsing fails
- **Allow Clarification** (default: true): Whether to allow the researcher to ask clarifying questions before starting research
- **Max Concurrent Research Units** (default: 5): Maximum number of research units to run concurrently using sub-agents. Higher values enable faster research but may hit rate limits

#### Research Configuration

- **Search API** (default: Tavily): Choose from Tavily (works with all models), OpenAI Native Web Search, Anthropic Native Web Search, or None
- **Max Researcher Iterations** (default: 3): Number of times the Research Supervisor will reflect on research and ask follow-up questions
- **Max React Tool Calls** (default: 5): Maximum number of tool calling iterations in a single researcher step

**Important Model Requirements:**

1. **Structured Outputs**: All models must support structured outputs. Check support [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/).

2. **Search API Compatibility**: Research and Compression models must support your selected search API:
   - Anthropic search requires Anthropic models with web search capability
   - OpenAI search requires OpenAI models with web search capability  
   - Tavily works with all models

3. **Tool Calling**: All models must support tool calling functionality
